She realized now that she\\'d been foolish to even ask, to give her grandmother more leverage with which to hurt her.\\n\\nHer husband worked for Jones Inc., though, far beneath Thora and Joseph\\'s level. Is that what had changed him from the sweet, fun-loving boy she\\'d met in college eleven years ago? Elena doubted anyone could stay sweet and fun loving around Thora, least of all someone as weak as Kirk. Because he was weak, she couldn\\'t fathom why he had chosen to fight the divorce. Why now, when she wanted him gone, did he refuse to leave?\\n\\nShe closed her eyes, as a headache nagged at her temples. Her divorce was the least of her concerns in light of her visions. The dissolution of her marriage was trivial in comparison to someone\\'s life. Irina? Had her baby sister been the woman in the fire in Elena\\'s first dream the previous night?\\n\\nShe refused to think about her second, trying to wipe it from her mind even as her body pulsed with frustration in the way it had ended. Too soon.\\n\\n\"Elena, are you all right?\" Strong fingers closed around her arm, offering support.\\n\\nHer heart lurched. Just with surprise, she told herself. Joseph seemed more the type to shake someone than hold her. Curiously enough she\\'d always respected that about him, that he wasn\\'t the type to coddle anyone, that he was so strong that he demanded strength from those around him.\\n\\nWhen she opened her eyes, his head was close. He had to be leaning, because he was tall, well over six feet with wide shoulders and a chest so muscular it strained the buttons on his gray shirt and suit. His deep green eyes softened with concern. Elena wasn\\'t used to a man looking at her like that, not since her father died. But underneath the concern was something that unsettled her even more, an awareness that hummed between them; another reason she could never use his first name. For them, it would be too intimate.\\n\\nLike her dream.\\n\\nShe resisted the urge to tremble and lifted her chin instead. \"I\\'m fine.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you are,\" he agreed, his voice deepening with innuendo as he teased her. He always teased her.\\n\\nHer palm itched to slap him. He didn\\'t know that she\\'d filed for divorce. She\\'d told no one yet. For all he knew she was a happily married woman. Didn\\'t anyone respect marriage anymore?\\n\\nHeat warmed her face, as an image from the dream tugged at her memory. Arms and chest rippling with muscles, wrapping tight around her, pulling her close so that skin brushed skin. She drew in a shuddery breath. But that had been just a dream, not a vision. She was never going to make love with him. She would make certain of it, and if she could change that part of her future, she could change more.\\n\\nShe was here, in her grandmother\\'s wing, because she couldn\\'t keep ignoring her visions. They weren\\'t going away; they just kept getting worse. Not for her, but for the people she saw in them. She had to help. Like that ancestor who had so long ago warned about the lightning that would cause the house fire and begin the vendetta, Elena had to take the risk—even if she was the one who wound up getting burned.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" she said, stepping around Joseph. \"I need to speak to her.\"\\n\\nThen she closed the door, shutting him into the hall and herself into her grandmother\\'s rooms. The parlor, a profusion of Victorian roses and fragile, antique furniture, misled the visitor into thinking Thora Jones a delicate, old-fashioned woman. Nothing could be further from the reality.\\n\\nDouble doors led off the empty parlor into the den. Without knocking, Elena opened those doors into her grandmother\\'s real sanctum: dark, heavy woods, dim light and the faint, lingering odor of pungently sweet cigars. Elena had never caught her smoking them, but she suspected it was one of her grandmother\\'s many vices.\\n\\nThe woman lifted her gaze from the files on her desk, which was cluttered with more picture frames than work. Most of the photographs were of Elena\\'s father, Elijah Jones. The only ones of Elena were snapshots taken with him. Thora\\'s parlor also had several pictures of him, among the gardening ribbons and plaques, but this room with its faint light and solemn atmosphere felt more like a shrine',\n",
       "  ' what your mother told me.\"\\n\\nHer grandmother\\'s laughter echoed in her ears, as Elena rushed out of her rooms. She slammed the door to the corridor, then sagged against it, squeezing her eyes shut on the image of Thora\\'s hateful face. Every confrontation with her grandmother left Elena this way, weak, shaking...with a little less of her soul.\\n\\n\"Are you all right?\"\\n\\nShe opened her eyes, confronting Joseph\\'s concerned gaze again. \"You stayed.\"\\n\\nHe nodded, those deep green eyes soft again with sympathy. \"Things never go well between you and your grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"So you thought what?\" She lifted a brow, relieved to feel anger, which made her so much stronger than fear. \"That I might need you?\"\\n\\nHaughty, scornful—she\\'d rather Joseph see her that way than weak. Like Thora, he wouldn\\'t respect weakness. But why did she want his respect? He was too much like her grandmother. That was why he\\'d been given the job that by birthright should have been hers. But refusing to hire her had been more favor than punishment for Elena. If she\\'d worked for Thora, she might have begun to act like her as well, and she never wanted to become that hateful, bitter and unscrupulous.\\n\\n\"I tend to forget that you hate me,\" he said, his wide mouth quirking into a wicked grin.\\n\\nSo did she. That scared her nearly as much as her grandmother\\'s threats, which weren\\'t empty. She had enough money and power to get whatever she wanted. Not that she especially wanted Stacia. She just wanted to manipulate Elena. Since she couldn\\'t do it through Elena\\'s father anymore, she would do it through Elena\\'s daughter.\\n\\nElena did understand the older woman. She understood that Thora couldn\\'t let her son go despite his death. She needed more than the pictures piled on her desk and adorning every wall of her rooms. Because Elena and Stacia were part of him, she wanted to keep them close even though she hated that Elena was also a part of her mother, and had been punishing Myra through her since the day she\\'d brought Elena to this house.\\n\\nJoseph stepped close, the sleeve of his suit brushing against the silk of her blouse. Even through the two layers of material, his heat penetrated, raising her temperature. Her face flushed. She would have stepped away, but her back was against the door. And he towered over her, imposing, intimidating.\\n\\nWas this why her grandmother had hired him? Because just his presence, his brawn and the breadth of his shoulders and chest, was threatening? Elena suspected the greater threat was the sharp intelligence burning in his green eyes.\\n\\n\"Why do you hate me, Elena?\" he asked. His voice, deep and soft, lifted the hair on the nape of her neck. His wicked grin never slipped, amusement lightening his eyes.\\n\\nDamn him, he knew. She wanted to but couldn\\'t quite hate him, no matter how much she tried. She opened her mouth, ready to list the reasons, some she\\'d vented before, like his subordinates sending her husband away on business too much. But that had been more help than hardship. She\\'d realized that absence hadn\\'t made her heart grow fonder, only Kirk more faithless. She couldn\\'t blame Joseph for that, since Kirk didn\\'t work directly under him. She couldn\\'t even blame Joseph for the dreams.\\n\\nAll she could do was ask, \"Why do you work for her?\"\\n\\nWas it blackmail? Like what kept Elena in this house, the threat of her grandmother using the considerable means at her disposal to take away what mattered most to Elena, her daughter? What was Thora holding over Joseph Dolce? What mattered most to this man?\\n\\nHe shrugged, and his arm moved against hers, wool scraping against silk. \"Money. She pays me well.\"\\n\\n\"To do her dirty work,\" Elena scoffed, inexplicably disappointed that he wasn\\'t being coerced, too. This was why she had to hate him, why she could never trust him. He was just as soulless and manipulative as his employer, willing to do whatever necessary for money and power. \"I hope it\\'s enough.\"\\n\\nHis dark head nodded, but his green eyes dimmed, the amusement gone. \"It\\'s a lot of money, more than I ever really thought a kid who grew up like I did could make.\" Wistfulness deepened his voice. \"I used to dream about the fast cars, big houses and fancy—\" the wicked grin flashed a brief appearance as he stared down at her \"—women.\"\\n\\nHe considered her a fancy woman? On the outside, she might look the part of an heiress, with the silk clothes and sleek hairdo and manicured nails. Inside, she was still that little girl who\\'d grown up in the back of a truck camper, eating cold canned food and wishing for a hot shower and a soft bed, one she hadn\\'t had to share with younger sisters who kicked and flailed',\n",
       "  ' elbows in their sleep. Guilt nagged at her, as it had twenty years ago, when she\\'d thought her wishing had caused her mom to lose her and her sisters. She\\'d gotten her hot shower and soft bed, but she hadn\\'t been able to sleep in it for a long time. She\\'d missed her sisters, flailing elbows and feet, too much.\\n\\n\"So you got what you wished for,\" she pointed out to Joseph, but for some reason she suspected he wasn\\'t any happier than she\\'d been. \"Was it worth it, selling out to Thora?\"\\n\\nShe had no doubt the older woman made him do things, probably illegal things, to get her what she wanted for her corporation and herself. Perhaps that was another reason why Thora hadn\\'t hired her; she\\'d known Elena would have wanted to run the company honestly.\\n\\nIrritation darkened his eyes. \"You can act all sanctimonious and self-righteous,\" he accused. \"You don\\'t have a damn clue how it is growing up with nothing—\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been poor,\" she interrupted him. But she hadn\\'t had nothing. She\\'d had her mom and her sisters. Their love. She swept an arm around the wide corridor full of antiques and framed artwork. \"And obviously I\\'ve been rich. I was much happier poor.\"\\n\\nHe stepped even closer, his legs brushing hers, only inches separating his chest from hers. She could nearly feel the beat of his heart beneath his wool suit and silk shirt. She lifted her palms, wanting to push him away. But she dropped her hands back to her sides and fisted them, not trusting herself to touch him...because she couldn\\'t trust him.\\n\\nInterest narrowed his green eyes as he studied her. \"There\\'s a helluva lot I don\\'t know about you, isn\\'t there?\"\\n\\n\"More than you could handle,\" she admitted.\\n\\n\"That sounds like a challenge,\" he said, the amusement back in his wicked grin and sparkling eyes, as he lifted her chin with the pad of his thumb.\\n\\nHe stroked her skin, which until that moment Elena had never known was so sensitive. She bit her bottom lip, resisting temptation. Then she lifted her fists, using them to shove against his chest so she could step away from the door and away from him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never backed down from a challenge, Elena,\" he warned her, as she walked away.\\n\\nIf he learned the truth, would he look at her like Thora did? Like Kirk had started to look at her, when he dared meet her eyes?\\n\\nLike she was crazy.\\n\\nGod, she wished she was, then she wouldn\\'t have to worry about her visions, any of her visions, coming true.\\n\\nElena sat up in bed, her back sinking into the pillows piled against the brass headboard. A book lay open across her bent knees, but she couldn\\'t concentrate on the words on the page, swimming in and out of focus. She was so tired but too afraid to sleep...for the dreams she might dream.\\n\\nTomorrow she would talk to Ariel. Together, they would find their little sister. They would make sure none of Elena\\'s visions of Irina came true. With that thought giving her some peace, she drifted off to sleep...until a cry awoke her. For once, it wasn\\'t hers, drawn out by a horrifying vision.\\n\\nShe threw back the blankets and ran the short distance down the hall to Stacia\\'s room, which was aglow with ambient light from the Strawberry Shortcake lamp next to the little girl\\'s bed.\\n\\n\"Sweetheart,\" she murmured, pulling the little girl into her arms. \"It\\'s okay. Shhh...\"\\n\\nStacia hiccupped out a soft sob and burrowed against her mother. \"Daddy...\" she called out sleepily.\\n\\nElena brushed her daughter\\'s blond curls off her damp forehead. \"It\\'s okay, honey. Mommy\\'s here.\"\\n\\nThe same could not be said of Daddy. Elena knew she\\'d done the right thing, taking the first step to end her sham of a marriage, for her daughter\\'s sake. If Mommy and Daddy no longer lived together, she would understand why he was never around, instead of her confusion giving her nightmares. She rocked the warm little body in her arms as Stacia snuggled against her.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Daddy?\" the little girl asked.\\n\\nNo doubt in another woman\\'s bed. But she couldn\\'t tell her daughter that. \"He\\'s away, honey. Remember? He had a business trip.\"\\n\\nStacia rubbed her eyes, which were the same pale blue as Elena\\'s and Thora\\'s. \"I saw him in my dream,\" she said.\\n\\nOf course she had to dream about the man; he was never around. Why wouldn\\'t he just sign the papers and officially end their marriage? Elena suspected he\\'d grown too accustomed to their big house and his fast cars and didn\\'t want to give them up. He\\'d worked with Thora and Joseph too long.\\n\\n\"Did you dream about your',\n",
       "  ' about his health. She had something more relevant to tell her. \"His name was Elijah.\"\\n\\nAriel stopped walking, her long, slim body taut and still. \"It was?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a family name they kept using even though my father\\'s ancestors changed their last name years ago, when they first came to America.\" That was why Ariel\\'s search for McGregor descendants who may have resumed the vendetta hadn\\'t turned up Thora. Or Elena. She\\'d found Thora only through the complaint sworn out against their mother.\\n\\nAriel\\'s eyes widened, the turquoise the only color in her pale face. \"What are you saying?\"\\n\\nFrom her sister\\'s reaction, Elena was pretty certain that she\\'d figured it out. \"My grandmother is a descendant of Eli McGregor. She named her son after him.\"\\n\\n\"After the man who killed our ancestor, burning her at a stake.\" Ariel\\'s voice cracked with emotion. Their mother had died the same way. Burned.\\n\\nWhile Ariel could see her ghost, Elena had witnessed the murder...in a vision. She blinked back tears, saddened that she would never have the chance to see her mother again.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re a McGregor.\" Ariel expelled a shaky breath, stirring the red hair that had fallen across her cheek.\\n\\nPride lifted Elena\\'s chin. \"And a Durikken.\"\\n\\nAriel sighed. \"I\\'ve been trying to find McGregors, trying to figure out which one of them might have resurrected the vendetta.\"\\n\\n\"You think I could be the killer?\"\\n\\nAriel studied her, as if assessing her older sister\\'s strength. Then she shook her head, tumbling her hair around her shoulders. \"No.\"\\n\\nElena\\'s pride stung; her sister hadn\\'t sounded convinced. \"Are you sure? After all you really don\\'t know me. Until just a couple weeks ago we hadn\\'t seen each other in twenty years.\"\\n\\nA little chuckle sputtered out between Ariel\\'s lips. \"Do you want me to think you\\'re the killer?\"\\n\\n\"No. I want you to really believe that I\\'m not.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right. We haven\\'t seen each other since we were kids, but I know you, Elena. You\\'re incapable of murder.\" Ariel\\'s turquoise gaze lifted toward the house.\\n\\nElena suspected she didn\\'t seek her niece\\'s bedroom window. She\\'d never invited her sister inside, so Ariel would have no way of knowing which wing was Elena\\'s and which Thora\\'s. Elena wanted her sister to have no contact with the bitter old woman. If not for Stacia having been tired from her fitful night, Elena would have taken her along to meet Ariel at the playground where they\\'d met before.\\n\\n\"What about your grandmother?\" Ariel asked.\\n\\n\"Her family changed their name from McGregor because they considered Eli McGregor a madman who should have been punished for what he\\'d done—\"\\n\\nBitterness hardened Ariel\\'s voice when she interrupted, \"But the townspeople had revered him for killing a witch.\"\\n\\n\"Or feared him,\" Elena said. \"He was crazy. The vendetta was crazy, and his children changed their name because they wanted no part of it.\"\\n\\nBut she couldn\\'t say the same of Thora, not and believe it. Her grandmother claimed she\\'d only taken away Myra\\'s daughters because she was an unfit mother, but Elena had always suspected something other than concern for the children or love of her son had motivated Thora\\'s actions. Vengeance.\\n\\n\"None of her family wanted anything to do with the vendetta?\" Ariel asked.\\n\\n\"My father was her only son.\" Perhaps that was why her love for him had bordered on obsessive. Did Elena love Stacia like that, so much that she shut out everyone else? Kirk had excused his absence by claiming that Elena had no room in her life for anyone but her daughter and her father. Not her husband. He might have been right, but Elena hated to think she was more than just physically like her grandmother.\\n\\n\"And your father\\'s dead,\" Ariel concluded, then shook her head. \"It\\'s all so incredible. How\\'d a McGregor hook up with a Durikken? Coincidence?\"\\n\\nElena glanced toward the house, not the wing where her daughter slept, hopefully, a dreamless slumber, but toward her grandmother\\'s wing. She hoped her parents\\' meeting had been just a coincidence. She bit her lip, then released it to sigh. \"My father was a good man. A loving man. He wouldn\\'t have sought our mother out to hurt her.\"\\n\\nAriel\\'s lips lifted in a wistful smile. \"Maybe he only wanted to apologize for what his family had done to hers all those years ago. And when they met, they fell in love.\"\\n\\nCynicism forced Elena to point out, \"It didn\\'t last.\" Not with the conflict and obstacles they\\'d had. She glanced again toward the house, to the shadow looming behind the gauzy curtains in her grandmother\\'s parlor.\\n\\nAriel\\'s head turned as she followed Elena\\'s gaze to the house. \"So',\n",
       "  ' there\\'s only you and her?\"\\n\\n\"And Stacia.\" But Elena had an uncomfortable feeling her daughter was mostly Durikken, cursed.\\n\\nFrustration knitted Ariel\\'s forehead. \"But maybe your grandmother has some distant relatives. You have to ask her.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s not going to help me. She doesn\\'t believe that we\\'re in danger.\"\\n\\n\"Did you tell her about our aunts?\" Like their mother, they had been murdered. But unlike Myra, their bodies had been found. Ariel had found them, hanged and crushed to death.\\n\\n\"Thora doesn\\'t want to believe that someone started up the witch hunt again.\"\\n\\nAriel sighed. \"Because then she\\'d have to accept that one of her relatives, no matter how distant, is a killer.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know for certain that a McGregor is behind this,\" Elena felt obligated to point out.\\n\\n\"Who else would resume the vendetta but a McGregor? Who else would even know about it?\"\\n\\nElena\\'s shoulders ached as if a weight had settled on them. \"You\\'re probably right.\"\\n\\nAriel reached out again, despite all the times Elena had pulled away from her, and squeezed her shoulder. \"You can\\'t blame yourself for this, just like you can\\'t blame yourself for Thora swearing out that complaint against Mama.\"\\n\\nPerhaps her sister knew Elena better than she\\'d realized despite her guilt causing her to keep Ariel at arm\\'s length. \"I don\\'t—\"\\n\\nAriel interrupted the denial with a shake of her head. \"You can\\'t help who your family is, who you are. You just have to accept it.\"\\n\\nAnd that was what Elena struggled with the most, accepting her ability and her conflicting heritage. \"That\\'s easier said than done.\"\\n\\nThe redhead bobbed in a commiserating nod. \"Do you have any visions of your own death, Elena?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\" She rubbed her hands over her bare arms, trying to chase away the chill, but it wasn\\'t on her skin; the cold was deep inside her. \"Sometimes when I\\'m dreaming, it\\'s like it\\'s me who\\'s being killed. Then I step back, and I see that it\\'s someone else.\"\\n\\nHer voice flat, matter-of-fact, Ariel acknowledged, \"Me.\"\\n\\n\"Or Irina. I\\'ve seen Irina.\"\\n\\nAriel remembered, \"On the streets.\"\\n\\nImages of her most recent vision played through her mind. \"He catches her.\"\\n\\nAriel\\'s eyes widened with shock and dread. \"Oh, God!\"\\n\\n\"And I think he kills her the way he killed Mother.\" Unless the image of the woman burning at the stake had been the memory of the vision of her mother dying. The woman had looked exactly like their mother. Unlike Ariel, who had accepted her ability as a gift, Elena struggled to even understand hers.\\n\\n\"We have to find our baby sister.\"\\n\\n\"I want to help you,\" Elena said. But she didn\\'t know how to use her ability, not unless the vision was really clear, and that had only happened once, when the killer had nearly ended Ariel\\'s life. Elena had noted the details of the dilapidated church where Ariel, her fiancé, David, and his friend, Ty, tracked the killer and his cult. But Ty had been hurt, and the killer had gotten hold of Ariel, tying a noose around her neck. David had gotten her away from the madman, but he\\'d been stabbed. If not for Ariel shooting the killer, David probably would have died. Thankfully they\\'d all survived. Regrettably, so had the killer, who\\'d gotten away.\\n\\nThat night, seeing Ariel and David\\'s love for each other, had forced Elena to face the reality of her loveless marriage. She hadn\\'t even told Kirk about her sister finding her.\\n\\nAriel began, \"If you want to help me—\"\\n\\n\"I do!\" Elena insisted.\\n\\n\"Then you have to accept yourself, Elena, everything about yourself.\"\\n\\nElena\\'s lips pulled up into a reluctant smile. \"I thought you were a teacher, not a psychiatrist.\"\\n\\nHer sister shrugged. \"I guess I must have picked up something from all the ones who talked to me when I was growing up, who tried to pass my gift off as a bid for attention, or a coping mechanism for losing my family.\"\\n\\nWhile her grandmother had had harsher explanations, a few counselors had told Elena the same things about attention and coping. Softly she acknowledged, \"Maybe they were right.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t believe that I see ghosts?\"\\n\\n\"Our mother was a con artist who staged séances to bilk people out of money.\" Until they\\'d been taken away from her, they\\'d helped.\\n\\nMaybe that was why Elena was drawn to Joseph; she wasn\\'t so different from him. She knew how it was to be a kid forced to do whatever necessary to survive. But she\\'d grown up and realized there were better ways. Someday, maybe, so would he.\\n\\nShe sighed. \"I don\\'t know what to believe.\"\\n\\nInstead of taking offense, her sister',\n",
       "  ' up his job. Elena had asked him the other day what Thora held over him; it was that. If he left Jones Inc., she\\'d make sure he\\'d never hold another powerful position. She might even send him to jail, if she wanted to risk going there herself. She might have been crazy enough to risk it, but Joseph wasn\\'t. Growing up, he\\'d spent a little time in jail. Confined. Powerless. He didn\\'t want to go back.\\n\\nElena sighed and made another surprising admission. \"Sometimes fear is all I feel.\"\\n\\n\"Elena, he\\'s not going to hurt her—\"\\n\\n\"I know.\"\\n\\n\"But you said—\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"I wasn\\'t thinking straight earlier. I was just reacting to my little girl being gone. Stacia has never spent a night away from me. I just want her home.\"\\n\\n\"So call Kirk.\"\\n\\nShe sighed again. \"He\\'s not going to bring her back just because I tell him to.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell him.\" With his fists once he found the weasel. When he\\'d suspected Kirk might pull something stupid, he\\'d warned her husband that if he hurt Elena, Joseph would kill him.\\n\\nInstead of being impressed with his offer, she laughed. \"Kirk is running because he\\'s scared. Scaring him more is not going to bring him back here.\"\\n\\nConfusion drew Joseph\\'s brows together. \"I thought he just wanted money.\" He gestured toward the envelope in her hand, containing what he\\'d figured was basically a ransom note; now he wondered.\\n\\n\"What\\'s he scared of?\" Joseph\\'s threat? God, he hoped that wasn\\'t why the bastard had taken off with her daughter.\\n\\nShe surprised him more when she calmly stated, \"Me.\"\\n\\nHe drew in a quick breath. \"Elena, what aren\\'t you telling me?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, refusing to reveal any more of her secrets. \"It\\'s better if you don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s it better for? You or me?\" he wondered aloud.\\n\\nShe studied him a moment, gnawing at her lower lip. Then she softly replied, \"Both of us.\"\\n\\n\"When Thora first made me CEO, I started visiting your dad. He talked so much about you that I thought I knew everything. Then you tell me the other day about being poor. And now...\" The way she\\'d acted, as if hypnotized into a trance.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a distraught mother.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get Stacia back.\"\\n\\n\"I have to,\" she muttered, \"before it\\'s too late....\"\\n\\n\"Elena, I want to help you.\" He didn\\'t know why, hadn\\'t even been able to explain to himself why he\\'d left the fund-raiser to check on her. Helping people was not his thing. No one had ever helped him. He\\'d taken care of himself. But he liked her little kid. Stacia was a sweetheart. And despite her never being all that sweet to him, he liked Elena, too. Maybe because she wasn\\'t all that sweet to him. The challenge thing again? Or did it go deeper?\\n\\n\"Then leave me alone,\" she said, all prickly pride again, as her eyes and voice got icy.\\n\\nMaybe she was high-society now, but somewhere inside Elena lurked a street fighter like him, determined to take care of herself. But she wasn\\'t selfish like him; she\\'d taken care of her father and daughter, too. He didn\\'t know which attracted him more, her compassion or her stubborn self-reliance. \"Elena...\"\\n\\n\"Go back to Thora,\" she advised him. \"You don\\'t want to risk losing your job. I know how important it is to you.\"\\n\\nGetting less important with every contact he had with Elena. He should have refused to do Thora\\'s bidding; he\\'d told her no before, on other things. But she\\'d only threatened to fire him this once...when it had to do with Elena.\\n\\nHe needed to leave her alone, just like she wanted. He wrestled into submission his desire to know what was really going on. She wanted him gone, and he needed to heed his instincts, the ones that warned him against getting involved any deeper with her. She was the kind of woman who needed more than a man like him could give. He\\'d vowed long enough to never be anyone\\'s husband or father.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave you alone for now.\"\\n\\nThat was all he could promise either of them.\\n\\n\"I called the police,\" Elena said, but her sister didn\\'t lift her gaze from reading the letter Kirk had left when he\\'d taken Stacia. \"They told me to call a lawyer.\"\\n\\n\"Did you?\" Ariel asked.\\n\\nElena nodded although she\\'d done more than call. The lawyer had been her first stop before coming here, to the penthouse Ariel shared with her fiancé, David. Elena paced over to the windows, which stretched from marble floor to vaulted plaster ceiling. Several stories below her the lights of Barrett sparkled against the black backdrop of',\n",
       "  ' night. The lawyer had complained that she\\'d stopped by too late.\\n\\nHer hands fisted as anger and frustration gripped her. And fear. She worried she\\'d be too late to protect her daughter, to stop the hands from reaching for her. \"My lawyer agreed with Kirk. If we go to court, I stand a good chance of losing Stacia.\"\\n\\nAriel blew out a ragged breath. \"I didn\\'t even know you were getting divorced.\"\\n\\n\"I thought I could handle it by myself. Then Kirk pulled this...\"\\n\\nAriel joined Elena at the windows, the letter crumpled in her trembling hand. \"You don\\'t have to handle everything by yourself anymore.\"\\n\\nHaving someone to turn to was a new sensation for Elena; she\\'d always had to be the strong one, for her dad, for Kirk, for Stacia.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t sure I should come here,\" she admitted.\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because you know now that I\\'m a McGregor.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re my sister,\" Ariel said. \"Of course I\\'m going to help you.\"\\n\\nShe wasn\\'t the only one who\\'d offered; Joseph wanted to help, too. Why? He couldn\\'t care about her; she\\'d never given him any reason to. What did he think was in it for him if he helped? The memory of a vision played through her mind, naked limbs entangled, lips melded, bodies joined...\\n\\n\"Elena,\" her sister called to her. \"I\\'m going to wake up David. I\\'d call Ty, too.\" He was David\\'s best friend, a cop, though suspended from the police force. His first favor for Ariel had cost him his job when the suspect he\\'d tried to arrest for abusing one of Ariel\\'s students had died; his second had almost cost him his life on the floor of the church where Ariel and David had nearly died as well. There was nothing Ty wouldn\\'t do for Elena\\'s sister. \"But he\\'s working hard on trying to track down Irina and the killer. He checks in, but he\\'s hard to get a hold of.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t take him away from his search.\" If Ty found the killer first, Stacia would be safe. And Irina, too.\\n\\n\"I agree. Ty needs to stay focused on finding the killer. And Irina. But don\\'t worry,\" Ariel assured her, \"between you, me and David, we\\'ll find Stacia.\"\\n\\nHer daughter wasn\\'t all that was missing. Before she\\'d left the house, Elena had searched for her pewter star. She\\'d wanted to use its warmth and presence for reassurance. For the security she\\'d never really known. But the charm was gone. Kirk, having seen her reach for it after nightmares, must have realized how important it was to her, so he\\'d taken it, too.\\n\\nAs Ariel moved to step around her, Elena caught her hand. \"When he took Stacia, he took something else, too.\"\\n\\nShe lowered her chin, unable to meet her sister\\'s questioning gaze. She knew how much faith Ariel had in the charms, that she believed reuniting them was the only way to stop the witch hunt. By letting the star out of her sight, by letting it get stolen, she\\'d let down her sister. Again.\\n\\n\"So tell me—what did he take?\" Ariel prodded.\\n\\n\"The charm.\"\\n\\nHer sister\\'s breath audibly caught, then she released it in a shaky sigh. \"That\\'s okay. That\\'s good. It\\'s with Stacia. It\\'ll keep her safe.\"\\n\\nTears burned Elena\\'s eyes, but she blinked them away. \"I had a vision of her,\" she shared, \"before I realized she was gone.\"\\n\\nAriel\\'s hand gripped hers, offering a reassuring squeeze. \"What did you see?\"\\n\\n\"My daughter, hiding in the dark. She hates the dark.\" She swallowed hard, forcing down the fear that threatened to overwhelm her.\\n\\n\"Elena, I\\'m so sorry....\"\\n\\n\"He finds her, Ariel. He pulls her out of her hiding place. And he hurts her.\" She squeezed her eyes shut, but she couldn\\'t force the image from her mind, the vision of those big hands tightening around Stacia\\'s arms until she cried out in pain.\\n\\nAriel pulled her into a hug. \"No, he won\\'t. We\\'ll find her first.\"\\n\\nElena borrowed some of her sister\\'s optimism and nodded. \"You\\'re right. We will find her first. Go ahead, wake David.\"\\n\\nIn finding Stacia, they had not a moment to lose. Elena never knew how much time would pass before her vision would become reality.\\n\\nAs Ariel released her, Elena took back the letter, but she didn\\'t need to reread it; she\\'d already memorized the hateful words. I know the truth. You\\'re crazy, unfit to be a wife and most certainly unfit to be a mother.\\n\\nKirk had dug up her past, the psychiatric visits, the anti-hallucinatory drugs. But his last line had been the worst. St',\n",
       "  '.\"\\n\\nShe had. Last night. She\\'d had an excuse to use it then, when the vision had unhinged her. But today...today she couldn\\'t go back to calling him Mr. Dolce. The words stuck in her throat. \"Should I trust you, Joseph?\"\\n\\nHe didn\\'t answer her question with his response. \"I\\'ll help you find Stacia. She\\'s a neat little kid. She should be with her mother. Kirk doesn\\'t deserve her.\"\\n\\nKirk couldn\\'t protect her. He was too weak and soon he might be dead. \"You know my daughter?\"\\n\\nHis lips lifted again in a full smile. \"Every time I stop by the house, she and I visit for a while. She shows me some toy, or how she jumps rope.\" He shook his head. \"I wasn\\'t supposed to tell you she does that in the house. It\\'s our little secret.\"\\n\\nJoseph Dolce and her daughter shared secrets? She blinked hard, clearing her eyes.\\n\\n\"You keep Stacia\\'s secrets. And Thora\\'s.\" She had no doubt the old woman had many. \"What about Kirk\\'s? Did you know about his affair?\"\\n\\nEven though Kirk didn\\'t report directly to Joseph, she doubted there was much of which he wasn\\'t aware. His nod confirmed her suspicions. \"So that\\'s why you filed,\" he said.\\n\\n\"His infidelity is just one of the reasons.\" Because if she counted her dreams, Kirk wasn\\'t the only one who\\'d cheated on their marriage.\\n\\n\"He doesn\\'t deserve you either, Elena.\"\\n\\nShe refused to be swayed by his compliment. Except in her dreams, she was immune to his charm. \"You should have told me.\"\\n\\nHe shrugged. \"I wasn\\'t sure you wanted to know. And I didn\\'t think you\\'d believe me.\"\\n\\nShe probably wouldn\\'t have, if she hadn\\'t seen Kirk and the woman in her head, wrapped up in each other\\'s arms. \"So who is she?\"\\n\\nHis brow furrowed. \"Elena—\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care about their affair.\" She didn\\'t want to, in a jealous fit, track down the woman. She had no time for that. \"My daughter might be with her,\" she pointed out. \"Who is she?\"\\n\\n\"Felicia Hanover. She works in Kirk\\'s department.\"\\n\\n\"Is she here today?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head. \"She didn\\'t show up for work.\"\\n\\n\"Give me her address.\"\\n\\n\"I checked her place last night,\" he said, \"and again this morning before I came into work. I caught her landlord. He said she left yesterday...with suitcases.\"\\n\\nElena\\'s breath shuddered out. \"So they planned this.\"\\n\\nJoseph nodded. \"Didn\\'t he say as much in the letter he left you?\"\\n\\n\"You really didn\\'t read it.\" Although he hadn\\'t acted as if he had, she\\'d had her suspicions that he\\'d violated her privacy. Since he hadn\\'t, maybe she could trust him.\\n\\nA light flashed inside her mind as images began to play. Her and Joseph, entwined, on his couch. She lay beneath him, his long, hard body pressing her into the leather until he eased up. His hands reached for her blouse, his big fingers fumbling with the little mother-of-pearl buttons before parting the yellow silk. His breath shuddered out, warm against her face, before his lips touched hers.\\n\\n\"You\\'re so beautiful,\" he murmured against her mouth.\\n\\nShe\\'d been told that before; his compliment shouldn\\'t have affected her. But her heart shifted, her pulse quickening. His lips brushed across hers in soft, teasing kisses.\\n\\nThen his hand settled over her breast, over the satin cup of her lemon-yellow bra. \"You\\'re so beautiful here,\" he said. \"Inside.\"\\n\\nNo one had complimented her heart before. She opened her mouth, inviting him to deepen the kiss. But still he teased, lapping at her lower lip with his tongue, then nibbling with his teeth, before finally giving her the kiss she wanted. Hot and possessive, his mouth pressed against hers, his tongue sweeping inside, filling her.\\n\\nHer heart raced beneath the palm of his hand as his fingers caressed the mound that spilled over the top of the bra. \"Joseph, more,\" she pleaded against his mouth as she clawed at the knot of his tie, pulling it free of the collar of his green shirt.\\n\\nHe\\'d already discarded his suit jacket, which lay on the floor beside the couch, along with her high-heeled pumps. She reached now for his buttons, her nails scraping his skin as she pulled his shirt open. He groaned, and his erection strained against his pants and pressed hard against her hip. \"Elena...\"\\n\\nShe lifted her hips, rubbing her pelvis against him.\\n\\nHis hands slid down her body, clasping her waist to hold her still. \"I want to take my time with you,\" he said, his voice low with the sensual threat.\\n\\nHeat pooled between her legs as',\n",
       "  ' her passion burned higher. She reached for his belt. \"I want you now,\" she insisted, using the imperious tone she\\'d learned so well.\\n\\nHe chuckled, then flashed his wicked grin, as he shifted his hips away from her so that she couldn\\'t unbuckle his belt.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t take orders well,\" he warned her. Then he unclasped her bra, pushing aside the satin cups to free her breasts. Instead of touching them, he stared, his hot gaze an erotic caress.\\n\\nHer skin flushed, and her nipples hardened, lifting up and begging for his touch. Elena drew her bottom lip between her teeth, biting the soft flesh, as she arched her back.\\n\\n\"You\\'re bad,\" Joseph admonished her. \"Very, very bad.\" Then he dipped his head, caressing her skin with his breath before touching his lips to her. His mouth trailed moist kisses around the curve of her breasts.\\n\\nElena shifted against the leather as her frustration built. She wanted more. She needed more. \"Joseph...\"\\n\\nA big hand settled over her shoulder, pulling Elena from the erotic vision. She shuddered with frustration, as heat and passion flushed her face and her body. She wrapped her arms around herself, so she wouldn\\'t reach for him and finish what had begun in her dream.\\n\\nOnly a dream. It wasn\\'t real. None of it was real. But the touch of his hand on her shoulder was, his palm leaving an imprint in the yellow silk of her blouse and on her skin beneath. She\\'d never been so aware of him...so desperate with wanting. She drew in a shaky breath, wrestling with the last, erotic aftershocks of her vision.\\n\\n\"There you go again,\" he accused, his deep voice dousing the flames of desire the vision had fanned to life. Nothing soft and loverlike about him now, he was his usual intimidating self. \"What the hell is happening to you? Where do you go inside yourself?\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, her hair sticking to the perspiration glistening on her face as the blond tresses tumbled around her shoulders. She fought an internal battle between her reluctance to share her secret with him and her desperation for his help in finding Stacia. He had resources she didn\\'t, and as he\\'d proved with having already gone to Kirk\\'s mistress\\'s apartment, he knew things she, Ariel and David didn\\'t.\\n\\nWould he think her crazy if she told him about the visions? But how else could she explain the urgency to find Stacia before the killer did...unless she told him everything?\\n\\n\"Elena?\" His deep voice vibrated with concern.\\n\\nShe rubbed her hands over her face, pushing back her hair. \"This is going to sound incredible. You\\'re probably not going to believe me, but I\\'m telling you the truth.\"\\n\\nHowever, the words stuck in her throat. She\\'d kept her secret for a long time, even from herself. She\\'d spent the past twenty years denying who and what she was; admitting it now wasn\\'t easy. She paced around the room, stopping near the door, tempted to leave with her secret kept. But then an image flashed through her mind, Stacia cowering in the dark, those big hands reaching for her, squeezing her little arms until she cried out in pain. Elena flinched as her daughter\\'s pain and fear became hers.\\n\\nJoseph\\'s hand cupped her chin, tipping it up, so she had to meet his concerned gaze. \"Tell me,\" he prompted. \"This isn\\'t just a custody battle. I saw your face last night. You looked like you do now. Scared out of your mind.\"\\n\\nHe was right about that. She was scared. And she was probably out of her mind to confide in him.\\n\\n\"What\\'s going on, Elena?\"\\n\\nHe\\'d never assured her that she could trust him, but he wasn\\'t the one she really needed to trust. She had to believe in herself first, before she could expect anyone else to do the same.\\n\\n\"I have two sisters,\" she began, in a rush.\\n\\nHis brow furrowed with confusion. \"Your dad told me he had only you.\"\\n\\n\"He wasn\\'t their father.\" She sighed. \"I don\\'t know who their fathers are. Probably neither did my mother.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me about her.\"\\n\\n\"She was a gypsy.\"\\n\\n\"A real one?\" he asked, his lips tipping into a slight grin. \"Living that vagabond lifestyle on the road?\"\\n\\n\"On the run,\" she corrected him. \"From a three-hundred-and-fifty-year-old vendetta.\" She blew out a breath, then continued, \"That was when the McGregors swore vengeance on all the descendents of Myra Durikken, my mother\\'s ancestor, who was believed to be a witch and subsequently burned at the stake. She had a vision of her fate and sent her daughter away before she could be killed, too. My sister Ariel and I like to believe that\\'s why our mother gave us up twenty years ago, that she was',\n",
       "  ' protecting us, too.\"\\n\\nIf Elena hadn\\'t had the vision of Kirk\\'s murder, she might have done the same with Stacia, given her up for her protection. But her sacrifice wouldn\\'t save Stacia; the only thing that would was finding her before the killer did.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand,\" he said, his fingers still on her face, almost absently stroking her skin. \"What does any of this have to do with Stacia and Kirk?\"\\n\\nImages flashed through her mind. The black-haired woman caught in the flames. Another woman being hanged. Another crushed to death. \"The witch hunt has begun again, Joseph. My mother and her sisters were recently murdered.\"\\n\\n\"God, Elena, I\\'m sorry....\"\\n\\n\"Me, too. I never got to see her again...except...\"\\n\\n\"Except what?\" he prompted her again, his green eyes darkening as he narrowed them.\\n\\nThe images rolled through her head again. The gruesome murders. The man in the shadows, concealed by the dark brown robe. A chill chased down her spine, raising goose bumps on her skin. He was out there, waiting to kill them.\\n\\n\"I saw her in a vision. I\\'m cursed, Joseph. Like Myra Durikken and my mother, Myra Cooper, I have visions. I saw my mother burned at the stake just like her ancestor. I saw one of my aunts hanged and the other crushed to death.\"\\n\\nHis hand fell away from her face, and he stepped back. Even though he\\'d denied he would think it of her, she could tell he wondered...was she crazy?\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t believe me,\" she said, hating that her voice rose with defensiveness, hating that she cared that he didn\\'t believe her, \"talk to David Koster.\"\\n\\n\"The computer mogul?\" His brow creased again. \"What does he have to do with any of this?\"\\n\\nElena lifted her chin, refusing to be ashamed any longer of who she was. She wasn\\'t twelve years old anymore and easily manipulated or intimidated. \"David is engaged to my sister. He knows everything.\"\\n\\nAnd he believed Ariel. But then he loved her. Elena wasn\\'t sure Joseph even liked her. Desired maybe, when he\\'d thought her one of those fancy women his wealth and power usually attracted. But now he knew the truth, whether or not he accepted it.\\n\\n\"I wish you\\'d tell me everything,\" he said, then drew in a breath, as if trying to collect his thoughts. \"You didn\\'t answer my earlier question. What does this \\'witch hunt\\' have to do with Stacia and Kirk?\"\\n\\n\"I had a vision last night, that Stacia was somewhere in the dark, alone and hiding.\"\\n\\nThe creases smoothed out as understanding glimmered. \"That\\'s why you went tearing upstairs to check on her.\"\\n\\nShe nodded. \"Then later I had another one, of Kirk dying.\" And maybe she died with him. \"Is Felicia Hanover blond?\"\\n\\nJoseph shrugged. \"She\\'s lower level. I\\'ve only seen her a couple of times. I don\\'t remember her hair color. Maybe brown. Maybe dark blond.\"\\n\\nFear rose, choking Elena. Maybe she herself was the one who died with Kirk. Who would save Stacia then? For the first time in her life, she had to rely on others, on her sister and her fiancé. And Joseph?\\n\\n\"I have to find Stacia before the killer does,\" she said, her voice rising with the hysteria she\\'d fought so hard to subdue. \"David\\'s running Kirk\\'s credit cards, but he hasn\\'t used them yet. David also has his friend, a suspended cop, asking his former colleagues to keep an eye out for Kirk\\'s car.\" Or he would when Ty checked in.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t want to ask Ty to do anything more. All his efforts were concentrated on the search for Irina, so the killer wouldn\\'t find her before they did. As an image of the black-haired woman, bound to the stake, flashed through her mind, Elena shuddered. Nobody would be safe until the killer was caught. And that was where the other half of Ty\\'s concentration was centered, on finding the killer.\\n\\n\"Since you\\'ve been honest with me, I have to be honest with you, Elena.\" Joseph sighed and rubbed his hand over his jaw. \"I saw Kirk yesterday, before he took off. I gave him a lot of money. He might have bought a different car, and he probably won\\'t need to use his credit cards for a while.\"\\n\\nWhat little hope she\\'d had in David\\'s ability to track down Kirk evaporated. Only dread filled her now. She\\'d trusted the wrong man to help her. \"You paid him to take off with Stacia?\"\\n\\n\"No. That wasn\\'t the intention.\" But from his tone, he\\'d obviously realized it was a possibility, which explained the reason for his visit last night. \"At least I don\\'t think that\\'s what Thora intended.\"\\n\\nHer grandmother had betrayed',\n",
       "  ' for so many years.\\n\\nHand shaking, Elena pushed aside the rest of the papers and uncovered something else in the bottom of the drawer, something cold and lethal. Thora stored a gun in an unlocked desk with a child in the house?\\n\\nElena wouldn\\'t have suspected someone as smart and controlled as her grandmother of doing something so careless...unless she felt she needed the gun readily at hand. Did she fear someone? Who?\\n\\nIf she had a gun in an unlocked desk, what did she have hidden away in her safe? Elena turned the chair toward the bookcase behind her. After pushing aside a few leaning, leather-bound volumes to reveal the safe, she punched in the code, her father\\'s birthday.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t the first time Elena had searched her grandmother\\'s office. She\\'d gone through the desk and safe before, when she was still a child, looking for clues to the whereabouts of her mom and sisters. She hadn\\'t found much then, some jewelry, cash, stock certificates and an old journal. Reading the brittle pages had clued her in to her true heritage but not the location of the relatives she\\'d cared about. She found less now. The cash was gone, and so was the journal.\\n\\nThe knob rattled on the door between the parlor and the hall, so Elena slammed the safe shut and whirled back toward the desk where the detective\\'s card stared up at her from the blotter. As the door opened, she slipped the card into the pocket of her skirt. Then she eased back in the chair, feigning nonchalance the way Thora had feigned it with her only a few short days ago.\\n\\n\"What are you doing in here?\" her grandmother asked in that cold, imperious voice.\\n\\nElena sighed. \"Just trying to figure out exactly how hateful you are.\"\\n\\nThora clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth, tsking her disgust. \"Talking more foolishness when you should be trying to find your daughter.\"\\n\\n\"You know she\\'s missing because Kirk took her on your orders.\"\\n\\n\"I know she\\'s missing because Mrs. Chapin told me you had Joseph looking for her. I thought you were a better mother than yours, that you\\'d have at least some idea of where your child is.\"\\n\\nAnger and pain rolled through Elena, but she held it back, fighting the urge to pound her fist on the desk and scream and yell. Thora wanted her to lose her control. \"I know you gave him money, a lot of money.\"\\n\\nAs if her legs had weakened, Thora dropped onto a chair in front of her desk. \"Kirk told you that?\"\\n\\nShe nodded, for some reason unwilling to bring Thora\\'s wrath onto Joseph, not that he needed Elena\\'s protection. He\\'d been taking care of himself for a long time.\\n\\nShe focused on her grandmother. \"How could you...\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t pay him to take her,\" Thora insisted.\\n\\nElena had had enough of her grandmother\\'s lies. \"Come on—\"\\n\\n\"I gave him money, yes, but not to take her away. I gave him money to leave. Your filing for divorce made Kirk desperate.\" Like Joseph had claimed. \"He didn\\'t want to give up this lifestyle. He\\'d grown quite used to it.\"\\n\\n\"So you gave him the money out of the goodness of your heart?\" Elena voiced her disbelief.\\n\\nThora shook her head, looking every one of her seventy-three years today. \"He threatened to go public.\"\\n\\nElena swallowed hard. \"He found out about my visions, about my past.\"\\n\\n\"About your psychiatric problems,\" Thora said, her mouth twisting with disgust even as fear brightened her pale blue eyes. Was Elena the one she feared, the reason she kept the gun close at hand?\\n\\nUntil she\\'d married Burton Jones, Thora had been poor, like Joseph. She loved the power her position in society gave her, and the truth coming out about her granddaughter\\'s past could threaten that position.\\n\\n\"Maybe Stacia is better off with her father,\" Thora maintained.\\n\\nElena shook her head. \"I know you don\\'t want to believe me. But someone\\'s started up the witch hunt again. I\\'ve seen the murders I already told you about. Last night I saw two more.\"\\n\\nThora\\'s face paled and she reached for a picture on her desk, the one of her great-granddaughter sitting on Elijah\\'s lap. \"You\\'ve seen hers?\"\\n\\nFor the first time Elena realized her grandmother actually believed in her ability. \"Not yet. But if I don\\'t find her and Kirk before the killer...\"\\n\\nThora lifted her gaze from the portrait, her pale eyes unfocussed. \"He won\\'t hurt her.\"\\n\\n\"Who?\" Elena\\'s heart clenched. Pulse racing, she jumped up from the chair and came around the desk to Thora. \"You know who the killer is!\"\\n\\nThe older woman shook her head. \"No...\"\\n\\n\"Thora, if you know something you have to tell me. Think about how much Stacia meant to',\n",
       "  ' chest, like the water, stealing her breath.\\n\\nBlood pounding in her ears, she heard not even the gurgle of water until the rope slackened around her ankles and she broke free of the surface again. Screams rent the air. Not hers. Her throat burned as she gasped for breath.\\n\\n\"Mommy! Mommy!\"\\n\\nShe blinked away the water running from her hair into her eyes and focused on the metal catwalk above the vat. Lack of oxygen clouded her vision, so the images wavered: a figure in a hooded brown robe, a little blond girl clutched in his arms. She wriggled, trying to break free of his grasp.\\n\\n\"Mommy! Don\\'t hurt my mommy!\"\\n\\nElena clawed her way to the top of the vat near the catwalk, then reached up. \"Stacia,\" she cried, her voice a hoarse croak. \"Stacia...\"\\n\\nThe man handed the child to Elena, dropping her into the water with her. But as Stacia fell, she grasped the man\\'s robe, pulling the hood free of his face.\\n\\nAnd Elena, after months of witnessing his murders, finally saw the killer\\'s face. \"No!\"\\n\\n## Chapter 8\\n\\n\"Elena, wake up! Honey, wake up!\" Strong arms wrapped around her, pulling her close. Fingers tunneled into her hair, pushing it back from her face. \"It\\'s okay. You\\'re safe.\"\\n\\nElena wiped her tears on the mat of soft hair covering the chest beneath her cheek. Her breath shuddered out. \"Just a dream. It was just a dream....\"\\n\\n\"No, it wasn\\'t,\" Joseph said, refusing to accept the lie she\\'d often told her husband.\\n\\nNo, it wasn\\'t a dream. None of it. Not making love with him and not what she\\'d just seen inside her head. But he\\'d lied to her, too, because he couldn\\'t help her, couldn\\'t keep her safe. She\\'d never be safe, not even in Joseph\\'s arms. Maybe especially not in Joseph\\'s arms.\\n\\nWhat the hell had she been thinking? Of course, she hadn\\'t been. She hadn\\'t wanted to think. She\\'d wanted to escape her thoughts, her fears, but she\\'d only raised more. She pulled away, sat up, raised her knees, and wrapped her arms around them.\\n\\n\"You\\'re doing it again,\" he said.\\n\\nPulling away? She should have done that sooner, before he wound up in her bed. Even though she\\'d filed, she wasn\\'t divorced yet, and after her disaster of a marriage, she\\'d be a fool to trust any man again—especially not a man like Joseph. Not a man for whom money and power meant more than integrity and honor. They had no future.\\n\\nShe had no future, not if her vision came to pass. And what about her daughter? How could she have, for even a moment, put Stacia out of her mind?\\n\\nJoseph\\'s voice rumbled close to her ear. \"You\\'re holding yourself together.\"\\n\\nA shrill little laugh slipped out as she neared hysteria. \"Barely.\"\\n\\n\"What did you see, Elena? Tell me.\"\\n\\n\"The killer.\" Her breath hitched, as his face flashed into her mind again. \"I saw the killer.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve seen the killer before.\"\\n\\nDavid had obviously told him everything. \"In a brown robe, with the hood raised. I\\'ve never seen his face. Until just now.\"\\n\\n\"What does he look like?\"\\n\\nShe reminded herself that her visions didn\\'t always give her the total picture of what was actually happening. \"I can\\'t be sure it\\'s him. I thought I had a vision of the killer before. I thought David was the killer. Maybe I misinterpreted what I saw this time, too.\"\\n\\n\"What did you see?\" Joseph asked again, his hands closing over her bare shoulders, his palms warm against her skin.\\n\\n\"I was drowning.\" Her throat and the back of her nose burned from water, as if she\\'d really been submerged. \"Someone was drowning me. And he had Stacia.\"\\n\\nJoseph pulled her back against his chest, wrapping his arms around her. Skin pressed to skin, reminding Elena of where they were...in bed and what they\\'d done. How had she lost control, how had she forgotten not only who she was, a distraught mother, but who Joseph was, a man she couldn\\'t trust?\\n\\n\"You saw the killer then,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I think.\" She shook her head. \"I don\\'t know. Maybe he was there because he was saving me, like David was actually saving Ariel.\"\\n\\n\"You know him,\" Joseph deduced. \"Is it Kirk?\"\\n\\n\"No. When this vision happens, Kirk\\'s probably already dead.\" Not that her visions ever followed any consequential order. Or any order at all.\\n\\n\"Then who\\'s the man?\"\\n\\nShe swallowed hard, forcing down her panic, as in her mind, the hood fell back, revealing mahogany hair, graying at the',\n",
       "  ' There was no ID in the hotel. They checked in under aliases.\"\\n\\n\"So no one knows who they are?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet.\"\\n\\nThat would buy Joseph some time, but not much, before the police were after him. \"So it\\'s clear?\"\\n\\n\"For now. You really shouldn\\'t have shaken my guys on the way there,\" Koster admonished him. \"They could have been witnesses. Backup if you needed it.\"\\n\\nIt had been too late for backup then. Joseph had a feeling he might need it again, though, once he tracked down Roarke. \"Where are they now?\"\\n\\n\"Back at the estate.\"\\n\\n\"Keep them there. Elena wants to go home.\" Although she hadn\\'t called it that. Was that another thing they had in common, growing up as they had, that they never felt as though they\\'d had a home?\\n\\n\"Not here? Ariel\\'s worried about her.\"\\n\\nAriel wasn\\'t the only one.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll call you back.\" When Elena wasn\\'t listening and he could tell the other man about his suspicions that something else was going on with her. Joseph pressed the end button, terminating the call, then turned toward Elena. \"They haven\\'t identified their bodies yet.\"\\n\\n\"Then drop me off at the estate,\" she imperiously directed him, as if nothing had changed between them over the past couple of days, as if he\\'d never held her in his arms, as if they\\'d never made love. Maybe she could forget.\\n\\nBut he couldn\\'t.\\n\\nHe held his silence until he pulled through the gates of the estate, but when she reached for the door handle, he caught her arm. \"You\\'re not going anywhere, not until you tell me what the hell\\'s going on!\"\\n\\nShe lifted her chin, and her eyes iced over like her voice. \"When I asked for your help, I made a mistake—\"\\n\\n\"We made love,\" he reminded her.\\n\\nHer lips tightened. \"And we shouldn\\'t have. Look what happened while we...\"\\n\\n\"Elena, we had no way of knowing. It\\'s not your fault.\" Just his.\\n\\nShe shook her head, unwilling to accept his assurances or his help. But there was something else going on, he was certain of it.\\n\\nShe turned her head away, staring out the window instead of meeting his gaze. \"I don\\'t want you involved any deeper—\"\\n\\nHe pulled her close, pressing her breasts into his chest while he took her mouth in a possessive kiss, sweeping his tongue between her soft lips to claim her as his. Just as his body had claimed hers mere hours ago. Panting, he lifted his head. \"I\\'ve been buried deep inside you.\"\\n\\nAnd he\\'d forever be a part of her now. The thought shook him nearly as much as the thought of her little girl at the mercy of a killer. Because he hadn\\'t acted fast enough?\\n\\n\"I care about you and Stacia,\" he admitted. And he\\'d never really cared about anyone but himself before. \"I\\'m not going anywhere, Elena. You\\'re not getting rid of me.\"\\n\\n\"He might,\" she said, her voice a soft quaver as she stared up at him, her pale eyes wide with fear.\\n\\n\"Roarke?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, not for sure.\" Her breath hitched, then she continued, \"But I see you dead. Like Kirk, bleeding to death on a floor.\" She slid her hands up his shoulders to the nape of his neck, her fingers delving into his hair. \"I don\\'t want you getting hurt, Joseph.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been taking care of myself for a long time, Elena.\" But her caring about him twisted something in his heart, reminding him that he still had one. Or he must have for he\\'d given it to her. And for the first time he lied to her: \"I\\'ll be fine.\"\\n\\nBut he wouldn\\'t be. Not if something happened to her or her daughter. He understood now why he\\'d gone so long without caring about anyone. It hurt too damned much.\\n\\nHe glanced out the window, to where a white van was parked across the street. Tinted windows concealed the interior, but he\\'d noted the plate as he\\'d driven up, so he had no doubt Koster\\'s guards were inside the van. She\\'d be safe here, within the estate. Physically. Knowing an animal had her daughter, she wouldn\\'t be emotionally or mentally safe...until she held her daughter again.\\n\\nHe tightened his arms around her, wanting to hold her together instead of watching her do it herself, as she\\'d done for so many years. Alone.\\n\\nBut he had to go. He had to find Stacia for her. For himself.

       "  ' softness of her hair, holding her close against his heart. And he lied to her again. \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to me. I promise.\"\\n\\nBut it already had. He\\'d fallen in love with a woman in danger, and her pain was his.\\n\\n\"I told you already. I don\\'t know where your daughter is.\" Thora leaned back in her chair and stared at the glowing tip of her cigar.\\n\\n\"But you know who took her.\"\\n\\nThora snorted, as if disgusted with Elena\\'s stupidity. \"Her father—\"\\n\\n\"Kirk had her for a little while. But the killer has her now. You know who that is.\" Elena studied her grandmother\\'s bent head, her suspicions growing over how the woman, who\\'d once delighted in staring Elena down, refused to meet her gaze. \"You know all about who started the witch hunt again.\"\\n\\nPart of Elena had always suspected Thora had something to do with it, from the moment she\\'d had that first vision of her mother dying in a fire. But Elena hadn\\'t wanted to believe that her grandmother could be that purely evil. She\\'d given birth to Elena\\'s father, a dear, sweet man, surely she had to have some decency...\\n\\n\"You\\'re talking crazy again,\" Thora said, still staring intently at the cigar.\\n\\n\"And you\\'re avoiding looking at me. I\\'ve noticed that for a while now,\" Elena realized. \"Actually since my father died. Do you hate me that much?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Thora shouted as she leapt to her feet. \"I hate what you are. I hate that my son loved your mother. I hate that he loved you.\"\\n\\n\"You selfish, stupid bitch,\" Elena hurled the insult. \"Didn\\'t you know him at all?\"\\n\\n\"She broke him—\"\\n\\n\"Because she knew you would never let him be with her, a Durikken descendant.\" Elijah had told her that himself, just before he\\'d died. \"You may have changed your name, but you didn\\'t drop the vendetta, not really.\"\\n\\nElena shook her head, more disgusted than afraid of this mad woman, despite all the years Thora had persecuted her with her insults and threats. \"And my father\\'s body might have been broken, but his heart was strong. He had enough love for all of us.\"\\n\\nThora dropped back into her chair, weakened by the very thing that had once made her so powerful—her hatred.\\n\\n\"You started the witch hunt again,\" Elena accused her, her stomach churning with dread and fear.\\n\\nThe older woman shook her head. \"You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he didn\\'t know. I thought it was the fever that had my father rambling incoherently. But now I realize what he was telling me. He met my mother because you sent him to find her.\" Elena had preferred Ariel\\'s romantic scenario, that her parents had met because her father had sought her out to apologize for the vendetta. That would have been an action of the man Elena had known and loved.\\n\\nHer voice thick with emotion, she accused, \"You sent him to kill her.\"\\n\\nThora weakly protested, \"Not kill her...\"\\n\\n\"What? Just make her life miserable?\"\\n\\n\"I wanted to find them. I wanted the charms,\" Thora admitted, her voice rising. \"They belong to McGregors, not Durikkens. That was what I sent your father to do, retrieve our property, not fall in love with a witch.\"\\n\\nElena gnawed at her bottom lip before saying, \"Not to have me.\"\\n\\n\"God, no.\"\\n\\nIf it wasn\\'t all so sick and disgusting, Elena would have laughed at the irony. Instead she stated the obvious, \"But my father didn\\'t bring back the charms.\"\\n\\n\"No.\" Thora sniffed, unable to accept her son was capable of failure. \"She bewitched him, so he forgot his purpose. So he forgot his heritage.\"\\n\\nElena lifted her chin, with pride in her father. \"He was no killer.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t ask him to kill her,\" Thora insisted, shrilly. \"He was supposed to get the charms. That was all.\" Not a daughter.\\n\\nThe old woman continued, \"God, I wished he would have. He needed them when he got sick. They could have healed him. They could have saved him.\"\\n\\nThora didn\\'t believe in witches but she believed in the charms having magical powers? Elena wasn\\'t the only one who\\'d lied to herself for a long time.\\n\\n\"So you sent someone else after the charms.\"\\n\\nThora nodded. \"Over the years. But none of them could track down your mother. With her abilities, they weren\\'t able to find her. That was when I realized that only a McGregor could.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why you didn\\'t use Joseph.\"\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t understand. A man like him, he has no history. He doesn\\'t even know his father\\'s name,\" she said as if repulsed. \"He can\\'t comprehend a history like ours.\"\\n\\n\"S',\n",
       "  ' in, trying to rest. She was also supposed to be forcing that vision. But she didn\\'t need to. She already knew what was going to happen...unless she managed to stop it. She couldn\\'t do that here. But she couldn\\'t leave either, not without Joseph or Ariel and David following her.\\n\\nProving her point, the door opened. \"I didn\\'t want to knock and interrupt,\" Joseph said, as if to explain his barging in, but she doubted he\\'d been concerned about her vision.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t believe me,\" she said, staring up at him. But she didn\\'t see his green eyes bright with life and purpose. She saw them wide with fear, dull with death. Goose bumps raised her skin, as the chill gripped her again, leaving her so cold that all the charms in the world couldn\\'t warm her.\\n\\n\"I believe you,\" Joseph insisted.\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"You don\\'t believe that you\\'ll die—\" her breath caught, burning in her lungs as her heart pounded fast and hard with fear \"—if you don\\'t back off.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you,\" he said again, his green eyes earnest, his darkly shadowed jaw taut with resolve.\\n\\nAccepting his claim, she nodded. \"You just don\\'t care.\"\\n\\nHe walked closer, then knelt on the floor in front of her. \"I care too much. That\\'s why I can\\'t walk away from this, from you.\"\\n\\nElena\\'s heart lurched. Did he share her feelings? How had they gone from adversaries to lovers in such a short time? It wasn\\'t real. Nothing was real. But the vision flashed in her mind again, Joseph lying on the floor. And she knew it was real.\\n\\nAll of it was real.\\n\\n\"You have to,\" she said, reaching out to run her fingers through his soft, dark hair. \"You have to—\" she leaned forward, pressing her lips to his. Then she pulled away and finished \"—leave me alone.\"\\n\\nJoseph caught her chin in his hand, holding her still as his gaze locked on hers, probing. \"Something\\'s going on. You\\'re too calm. It\\'s almost as if you\\'re hiding—\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, pulling free of his grasp and rising from the bed. \"I can\\'t hide. Not anymore. I know what I am, Joseph. I\\'ve accepted that.\"\\n\\nA witch, maybe. But first and foremost, a mother who would do anything to save her child. Even sacrifice her own life. But not his. She couldn\\'t let him lay down his life, too.\\n\\nAnd she had no doubt that he would. The fear that he\\'d claimed to not feel in so long, it was in his eyes now, not just in her vision. The green gleamed with fear and suspicion.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to leave you alone,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be fine,\" she promised him, as she walked toward the door.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll call me? You\\'ll tell me what you see if you have another...\"\\n\\nShe nodded. \"I\\'ll tell you everything.\" And she would. Later. If she lived through it.\\n\\nShe\\'d bought some time for her daughter, some time for herself. Knowing her plan might cost her her life, she wanted to make the best use of those moments. She turned toward the door...and locked it.\\n\\nThen like Ariel had hurled herself into David\\'s arms, Elena vaulted into Joseph\\'s, knowing he\\'d catch her. By his own admission, he wasn\\'t the most honorable man. He\\'d done things of which he obviously wasn\\'t proud. Maybe that was why he was so determined to help her, to redeem himself, to become that white knight he\\'d sworn he couldn\\'t be for her.\\n\\nDespite all his warnings about not trusting him, not counting on him, she knew he\\'d be there. If she let him.\\n\\nShe could only let him for this...for his kiss. For his touch. Reaching up, she delved her fingers into the softness of his dark hair and pulled his mouth down to hers. This could be the last time she felt anything but fear...and maybe regret.\\n\\nHis arms wrapped tight around her, holding her close to his madly pounding heart. The beat of hers echoed his. Frantic. She pushed her tongue through his lips, sliding it over his.\\n\\nHe groaned, then kissed her back with the same desperate passion with which she\\'d kissed him. His hands slid over her back, pressing her against him until she couldn\\'t draw a breath without breathing him in, the musk and citrus that she\\'d first smelled in her dreams.\\n\\nJoseph wasn\\'t a dream. He was real. Alive. And for the moment, so was she.\\n\\nShe pulled his shirt from his pants, then raked her nails up the satin-soft skin of his back. Muscles rippled beneath her touch. He groaned again, then tore his mouth from hers to utter her name. \"Elena?\"\\n\\nShe answered the question in his voice',\n",
       "  '\"No,\" she insisted, her voice going shrill with denial, \"I just wanted you to find the charms.\"\\n\\n\"And the witches. I was just supposed to let them live once I reclaimed the charms? No, we both know that\\'s not what you wanted. You want them dead. You just don\\'t have the guts, or the power, to do it yourself,\" he berated her cowardice. \"So you\\'re using me.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not what—\"\\n\\nDonovan silenced her by raising the gun, by pointing the barrel at her. \"Well, I have the guts to pull the trigger, Thora.\"\\n\\nAnd he did just that, sending the bullet through her head. Blood sprayed across the bookshelf behind her, spattering the safe in which she\\'d kept Eli McGregor\\'s journal locked away for far too long.\\n\\n\"Soon, very soon,\" he promised her, staring into her dead eyes. \"I\\'ll have all the power....\"\\n\\nHe couldn\\'t do what David Koster could, calmly sit and tap on a keyboard. Sure, the guy was doing something by hacking into records and pulling up everything on the computer that had anything to do with Donovan Roarke: his phone bill, his lease agreements, his divorce decree. And maybe Koster would find some information that would lead them to the psycho, but not fast enough for Joseph. And not physical enough.\\n\\nHe couldn\\'t sit, especially not now that Koster had learned that the bodies had been identified. Warrants had been issued for him and Elena, to pick them up for questioning in the murders. He couldn\\'t wait around for the police to track him down; he had to do something.\\n\\nKoster had understood, muttering something about Joseph reminding him of his friend Ty, the cop they hadn\\'t been able to reach. But Joseph worried that Elena might not understand; that when she awakened, she\\'d resent his leaving.\\n\\nDespite her insistence on being alone, he\\'d checked in on her before he left the penthouse. She\\'d been sleeping, her chest rising and falling with unsteady breaths as tears streaked from her closed eyes. Even in her sleep, she couldn\\'t escape her fears. Even in his arms, making frantic love with him, she hadn\\'t escaped them. As he\\'d held her, as he\\'d driven deep inside her, he\\'d seen the fear in her eyes, felt it in her body. That was why she\\'d made love to him, both times, to escape the nightmare her life had become.\\n\\nHe understood why she\\'d used him, and he didn\\'t care. He would do anything to alleviate Elena\\'s fears. But the only thing that would do that forever was bringing Stacia back to her. He had to find her little girl.\\n\\nKoster\\'s files had given Joseph a starting point for his search. Some of Roarke\\'s leases and the contacts he\\'d made when he\\'d formed a cult a few months ago had brought back memories for Joseph. The cult was gone now; David had seen to that. All of the members had been rounded up and questioned, but none had admitted to knowing the identity of the cult leader. Now that they knew his identity, other questions could be asked. And Joseph intended to do the asking. Some of the members hadn\\'t had a real address, just the street.\\n\\nHe pulled his SUV to the curb of one of the streets on the east side of Barrett. This abandoned industrial area housed only empty warehouses and the homeless. He knew these streets well. He\\'d lived on them for years. In the distance he noted the crooked steeple of an old church, the bell hanging drunkenly in the tower, dangling from only a few ropes.\\n\\nRoarke had used that church as the headquarters for his cult. Koster had wondered why the killer had used this area, that church. Now that they knew the killer\\'s identity, they\\'d discovered why. Roarke had been a cop for a short time, and as a rookie, this had been his beat.\\n\\nJoseph would have been gone then. He\\'d clawed his way off the streets and back to school, knowing that an education was the only way he\\'d ever escape this life. Now he opened the door to his truck and stepped back in time, confronting the ghosts of his past for the promise of a future. Elena\\'s and Stacia\\'s. He didn\\'t expect to be part of it; that wasn\\'t why he wanted to find her daughter, to earn Elena\\'s love.\\n\\nShe could never love a guy like him, a guy who had once lived here. He slammed the door and clicked the keyless entry, locking the Lincoln Navigator. Not that locks made much difference down here. He could open a locked vehicle without much problem, like he\\'d opened Roarke\\'s office and desk. For Elena, he\\'d been willing to return to his old life.\\n\\nBut his instincts were rusty. He\\'d been lucky David had been the one to catch him, that it hadn\\'t been Roarke\\'s gun he\\'d'],\n",

       "{'all_ref_text': ['Passage:\\nGaius Octavius (proconsul)\\nGaius Octavius  (about 100 – 59 BC) was an ancestor to the Roman Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. He is the father of the Emperor Augustus, step-grandfather of the Emperor Tiberius, great-grandfather of the Emperor Claudius, great-great grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, and great-great-great grandfather of the Emperor Nero. Hailing from Velitrae, he descended from an old, wealthy equestrian branch of the gens Octavia. Despite being from a wealthy family, his family was plebeian, rather than patrician. As a novus homo (\"new man\"), he would not be of a senatorial family.\\n\\nHis grandfather, Gaius Octavius, fought as a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His father Gaius Octavius was a municipal magistrate who lived to an advanced age. He is a distant relative (possibly as third cousins, through their ancestor Gnaeus Octavius Rufus) to Gnaeus Octavius, the consul of 87 BC who led the opposition to Lucius Cornelius Cinna.\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nOctavius\\' first wife was named Ancharia. The two had a child (named Octavia Major). It is not known how the marriage ended, although it is possible that Ancharia died during child birth. He later married the niece of Julius Caesar, Atia Balba Caesonia. How they met is not known, although Atia\\'s family on her father\\'s side (the Balbi) lived close to Velitrae, which was the ancestral home of the Octavii. They had two children: Octavia Minor and the Emperor Augustus, the latter of whom was born in 63 BC.\\n\\nPolitical career\\n\\nOctavius was elected quaestor, believed to have been in 70 BC. In 61 BC, he was elected praetor. In 60 BC, after his term had ended, he was appointed propraetor, and was to serve as governor (praefectus pro praetor) of Macedonia. Before he left for Macedonia, the senate sent him to put down a slave rebellion at Thurii. These slaves had previously taken part in the rebellions of Spartacus and Catiline. He then left for Macedonia and proved a capable administrator, governing \"courageously and justly\", his deeds included leading the Roman forces to victory in an unexpected battle against the Thracian Bessian tribe. Cicero had high regard for his diplomatic dealings. Because of his successful term as governor of Macedonia, he won the support necessary to be elected consul.\\n\\nIn 59 BC, Octavius sailed to Rome, to stand for election as consul. However, he died in Nola, before arriving in Rome. He supposedly died in the same bedroom where his son Augustus would pass away many years later.  His career is summarized in an inscription erected by his son on the forum he built in Rome: \\n\\nC(aius) Octavius C(ai) f(ilius) C(ai) n(epos) C(ai) pr[on(epos)]\\npater Augusti\\ntr(ibunus) mil(itum) bis q(uaestor) aed(ilis) pl(ebis) cum\\nC(aio) Toranio iudex quaestionum\\npr(aetor) proco(n)s(ul) imperator appellatus\\nex provincia Macedonia\\n\\n“Gaius Octavius, son, grandson and great-grandson of Gaius,\\nfather of Augustus,\\ntwice military tribune, quaestor, aedile of the plebs together with\\nGaius Toranius, judge,\\npraetor, proconsul, proclaimed imperator\\nin the province of Macedonia”\\n\\nFamily tree of the Octavii Rufi\\n\\nSince the last Gaius Octavius (Augustus) was adopted by his great-uncle Julius Caesar and become one of the Julii Caesares, the family\\'s original nomen gentile was not descended to his only daughter (i.e. Julia the Elder) and adopted sons (i.e. Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Tiberius, Agrippa Postumus), which end the Octavii Rufi\\'s male line.\\nQuestion:\\nWhat is Gaius Octavius better known as?\\nAnswer:\\nGAIVS•IVLIVS•CAESAR•OCTAVIANVS\\nPassage:\\nNix v. Hedden\\nNix v. Hedden,,  was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that, under U.S. customs regulations, the tomato should be classified as a vegetable rather than a fruit.  The Court\\'s unanimous opinion held that the Tariff Act of 1883 used the ordinary meaning of the words \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\", instead of the technical botanical meaning.\\n\\nBackground of the case\\n\\nThe Tariff Act of March 3, 1883 required a tax to be paid on imported vegetables, but not fruit. The case was filed as an action by John Nix, John W. Nix, George W. Nix, and Frank W. Nix against Edward L. Hedden, Collector of the Port of New York, to recover back duties paid under protest. Botanically, a tomato is a fruit because it is a seed-bearing structure growing from the flowering part of a plant. \\n\\nAt the trial, the plaintiffs\\' counsel, after reading in evidence definitions of the words \"fruit\" and \"vegetables\" from Webster\\'s Dictionary, Worcester\\'s Dictionary, and the Imperial Dictionary, called two witnesses, who had been in the business of selling fruit and vegetables for 30 years, and asked them, after hearing these definitions, to say whether these words had \"any special meaning in trade or commerce, different from those read\".\\n\\nDuring testimony, one witness testified that in regard to the dictionary definition:\\n\\nAnother witness testified that \"I don\\'t think the term \\'fruit\\' or the term\\'vegetables\\' had, in March 1883, and prior thereto, any special meaning in trade and commerce in this country different from that which I have read here from the dictionaries.\" \\n\\nBoth the plaintiffs\\' counsel and the defendant\\'s counsel made use of the dictionaries. The plaintiffs\\' counsel read in evidence from the same dictionaries the definitions of the word tomato, while the defendant\\'s counsel then read in evidence from Webster\\'s Dictionary the definitions of the words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff then read in evidence from Webster\\'s and Worcester\\'s dictionaries the definitions of potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.\\n\\nThe Court\\'s decision\\n\\nThe court unanimously decided in favor of the respondent and found that the tomato should be classified under the customs regulations as a vegetable, based on the ways in which it is used, and the popular perception to this end. Justice Horace Gray, writing the opinion for the Court, stated that:\\n\\nJustice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (Brown v. Piper, [http://www.justia.us/us/91/37/case.html 91 U.S. 37], [http://www.justia.us/us/91/42/case.html 42], and Jones v. U.S., 137 U.S. 202, 216) stated that when words have acquired no special',\n",
       "  ' meaning in trade or commerce, the ordinary meaning must be used by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray acknowledged that botanically, tomatoes are classified as a \"fruit of the vine\"; nevertheless, they are seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as a main course instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that beans were seeds — Justice Bradley, in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly found that though a bean is botanically a seed, in common parlance a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.\\n\\nSubsequent jurisprudence\\n\\nNix has been cited in three Supreme Court decisions as a precedent for court interpretation of common meanings, especially dictionary definitions. (Sonn v. Maggone, ; Saltonstall v. Wiebusch & Hilger, ; and Cadwalder v. Zeh, ). Additionally, in JSG Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc., 917 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1990), a case unrelated to Nix aside from the shared focus on tomatoes, a judge wrote the following paragraph citing the case:\\n\\nIn 2005, supporters in the New Jersey legislature cited Nix as a basis for a bill designating the tomato as the official state vegetable.\\nQuestion:\\nThe American 1893 Nix v Hedden court case determined (and still), for US customs taxation purposes, based on conventional usage, what to be a vegetable and not a fruit?\\nAnswer:\\nTomato\\nPassage:\\nHablot Knight Browne\\nHablot Knight Browne (10 July 1815 – 8 July 1882) was an English artist.  Well-known by his pen name, Phiz, he illustrated books by Charles Dickens, Charles Lever, and Harrison Ainsworth.\\n\\nBiography\\n\\nOf Huguenot ancestry, Hablot Knight Browne was born in England, in Lambeth (near London) on Kennington Lane.  He was the fourteenth of Catherine and William Loder Browne\\'s fifteen children. According to Valerie Browne Lester, Phiz was in fact the illegitimate son of his putative eldest sister Kate and Captain Nicholas Hablot of Napoleon\\'s Imperial Guard. There is some uncertainty regarding the exact date of birth. 10 July 1815 is the date given by Valerie Browne Lester, his great-great-granddaughter. John Buchanan-Brown in his book Phiz!: illustrator of Dickens\\' world says 12 July 1815. The date on his Christening record of 21 December 1815 at St Mary\\'s Church, Lambeth, Surrey, England gives 11 June 1815, as does the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition and 15 June 1815 (Dictionary of National Biography). A copy of the program from his burial service, which is still owned by the Browne family, says he was born 10 July 1815. \\n\\nWhen he was 7 years old, his father William Browne abandoned his family, changed his name to Breton and sailed with embezzled funds to Philadelphia where he became known for his watercolour paintings. William Browne was then declared dead by his wife Catherine. \\nThomas Moxon, husband of William\\'s sister Ann Loder Browne, helped to support the family, who were left badly off.\\n\\nBrowne was apprenticed to William Finden, an engraver, in whose studio he obtained his only artistic education. However, he was unsuited for engraving, and having during 1833 secured an important prize from the Society of Arts for a drawing of John Gilpin, he abandoned engraving in the following year and began other artistic work, with the ultimate object of becoming a painter.\\n\\nArtistic career\\n\\nIn the spring of 1836, he met Charles Dickens. It was at the time when Dickens was looking for someone to illustrate  Pickwick. Browne had been the illustrator of his little pamphlet Sunday under Three Heads. In the original edition of Pickwick, issued in shilling monthly parts from early in 1836 until the end of 1837, the first seven plates were drawn by Robert Seymour,  who committed suicide in April 1836. The next two plates were by Robert William Buss.\\n\\nBrowne and William Makepeace Thackeray visited the publishers\\' office with specimens of their work for Dickens\\'s inspection. The novelist preferred Browne. Browne\\'s first two etched plates for Pickwick were signed \"Nemo,\" but the third was signed \"Phiz,\" a pseudonym which was retained in future. When asked to explain why he chose this name he answered that the change from \"Nemo\" to \"Phiz\" was made to harmonize better with Dickens\\'s \"Boz.\"\\n\\nPhiz developed the character Sam Weller graphically just as Seymour had developed Pickwick. Dickens and Phiz became good friends and in 1838 travelled together to Yorkshire to see the schools of which Nicholas Nickleby became the hero: afterwards they made several journeys of this nature in company to facilitate the illustrator\\'s work. Other Dickens characters illustrated by Phiz were Squeers, Micawber, Guppy, Major Bagstock, Mrs Gamp, Tom Pinch and David Copperfield.\\n\\nOf the ten books by Dickens which Phiz illustrated, he is most known for David Copperfield, Pickwick, Dombey and Son, Martin Chuzzlewit and Bleak House. Browne made several drawings for Punch in his early days and also towards the end of his life. He designed the wrapper which was used for eighteen months from January 1842. He also contributed to Punch\\'s Pocket Books.\\n\\nIn addition to his work for Dickens, Phiz illustrated more than twenty of Lever\\'s novels (among them Harry Lorrequer, Charles O\\'Malley, Jack Hinton and the Knight of Gwynne). He also illustrated Harrison Ainsworth\\'s and Frank Smedley\\'s novels. Mervyn Clitheroe by Ainsworth is one of the most accomplished of the artist\\'s works. Browne was in continual employment by publishers until 1867, when he suffered an illness that caused a degree of paralysis. After recovering, he produced many woodcuts. In 1878 he was awarded an annuity by the Royal Academy. His health gradually worsened until he died on 8 July 1882.\\n\\nMost of Browne\\'s work was etched on steel plates because these yielded a far larger edition than copper. Browne was annoyed at some of his etchings being transferred to stone by the publishers and printed as lithographic reproductions. Partly with the view to prevent this treatment of his work, he employed a machine to rule a series of lines over the plate in order to obtain what appeared to be a tint; when manipulated with acid this tint gave an effect somewhat resembling mezzotint, which at that time it was found practically impossible to transfer to stone.\\n\\nFour of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens. \\n\\nGallery\\n\\nFile:Phiz-Sarony- 1870s.jpg|Browne photographed by Sarony c.1870s\\nImage:Hablot Knight Browne blue plaque.jpg|Blue plaque',\n",

Although recently developed, it has become an icon of Spanish culture. \\n\\nPreparation and serving \\n\\nKalimotxo is served in bars in short glass tumblers. Plenty of ice is added, then the red wine and cola. In other areas the drink is served in tall glasses. Sometimes Ouzo or anise flavoring is added. Another variation calls for a lime twist.\\n\\nA common way of serving kalimotxo is in one liter drinking glasses made of plastic, called minis, cachi, macetas, litros, cubalitros or jarras. The mixture is made directly in this one-liter mini, and often the bottles of cola are reused to make more of the mixture. This is done by emptying half of a two-liter cola bottle and adding one litre of red wine to the bottle. Ice is usually added to the drink. The minis are then shared among the group of drinkers, especially during the botellón drinking street gatherings.\\n\\nIn times of fewer available resources, a common occurrence among Spanish youth, (lack of one liter\\'mini\\') drastic measures are taken by young Spaniards in order to save money. One common cheap way of mixing Kalimotxo involves a plastic bag and the Tetra Brik cartons of cheap red wine (Don Simón is a common brand). An entire two liter bottle of Coca-Cola and two liters of wine are emptied into a plastic shopping bag. Once the concoction is mixed in the bag, the bag is squeezed tightly around the rim of the two litre Coca-Cola bottle and the contents of the bag are poured into the bottle. The now-empty Tetra Brik wine cartons are fully opened and peeled back as to mimic the function of the\\'mini\\'. The Coca-Cola bottle is then used as a distribution device to fill the makeshift\\'mini\\'.\\n\\nOne variation of the drink is achieved by adding a dash of blackberry liqueur. Similar concoctions using red wine include pitilingorri or caliguay (50% white wine and 50% lemon-flavored soft drink), (see spritzer); pitilin gorri (50% red wine and 50% orange soda). \"Tinto de verano\", more common outside of the Basque country, is half red wine and half \"Casera\", a mildly sweet sparkling water. In another variation, one may add to the 50/50 cola and red wine drink a dash of the Greek apertif Ouzo to create a drink called a Pallas.\\n\\nName \\n\\nIt is not clear where the name comes from. In the early 1970s it was called Rioja Libre or Cuba Libre del pobre (poor man\\'s Cuba Libre) in some Spanish provinces.  The current name, \"Kalimotxo\", is attributed to the \"Antzarrak cuadrilla\" (\"Geese young friends circle\"), which supposedly coined it during the 1972 Puerto Viejo festivities (in Algorta, Getxo, Basque Country). Legend has it that the servers in one of the \"txosna\" (stands in Basque festivals where drinks are served) noticed that the wine they had bought was not in good condition, so they decided to mix it with something to kill the sour taste. The inventors of the mixture named it after two friends of the cuadrilla known as \"Kalimero\" (after the Calimero chicken character) and \"Motxo\", hence the name \"Kalimotxo\". The name caught on and became popular throughout Spain. \\n\\nThe spelling kalimotxo has been in use in the Southern Basque Country since the 1970s. The Sandevid corporation, which used to sell prepared kali, used the spelling kalimocho.\\n\\nIn kalimotxo and motxo, the Basque sound tx is pronounced like ch in both English and Spanish. Since the name is now common throughout Spain, however, it is commonly respelled calimocho in accordance with Spanish orthography.  In Catalan, the word is usually spelled calimotxo, although kalimotxo is also common.\\n\\nAlternative names include Rioja libre (from \"Rioja\", and \"Cuba Libre\"), kali, motxo. In Chile the drink is known as jote (Chilean Spanish for the black vulture). In Romania it is often called motorină, meaning diesel fuel, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, the Republic of Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia and other former Yugoslav republics it is known as bambus (meaning bamboo) and musolini (as in Benito Mussolini).. In the Czech Republic it is known as houba (meaning mushroom), and in Hungary as Vadász (meaning hunter) or vörösboros kóla (meaning cola with red wine) or VBK for short. In Mozambique and South Africa it is known as Catemba, and in Germany it is sometimes called Kalte Muschi (cold pussy) or Korea.\\nQuestion:\\nThe Spanish drink calimocho consists of red wine mixed with what?\\nAnswer:\\nCola (genus)\\nPassage:\\nA Touch of Glass\\n\"A Touch of Glass\" is an episode of the BBC sit-com, Only Fools and Horses, first screened on 2 December 1982 as the final episode of series 2. It was the first episode of the show to attract over 10 million viewers.\\n\\nIn the episode, the Trotters are hired to clean some priceless chandeliers in a country mansion. The scene when they accidentally smash one of the chandeliers came second in a Gold poll to find the best Only Fools and Horses moment. \\nSynopsis\\n\\nDuring a trip out to the countryside Kent to buy a consignment of musical china cats which play the song \"How much is that doggie in the window?\", Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad stop to assist a woman whose car has broken down. The woman turns out to be a member of the  aristocracy, Lady Ridgemere. They tow her home and are grudgingly invited in by the snobbish Lord Ridgemere.\\n\\nThe Trotters quickly outstay their welcome at the mansion. Whilst there, Del overhears Lord Ridgemere haggling with someone on the telephone about the cost of cleaning their two priceless Louis XIV chandeliers. Sensing opportunity, Del tricks the Lord into believing that chandeliers are the Trotters\\' family business and agrees to carry out the necessary work at a knock-down price.\\n\\nThe Trotters return to the mansion a week later to clean the chandeliers, though the Lord and Lady are away on holiday. Grandad goes upstairs to unscrew the holding bolt for one of the chandeliers while Del and Rodney climb up on step ladders with a blanket ready to catch it. However, unbeknown to Del and Rodney (and the audience), Grandad is actually loosening the bolt for the adjacent chandelier. He knocks the bolt out, and as Del and Rodney are ready to catch their chandelier, the second chandelier plumm',\n",
       "  'ets to the ground and smashes to pieces. After verifying with the butler that they never gave any of their contact details to the Ridgemeres, the Trotters run away as fast as they can and escape from the mansion in their van.\\n\\nEpisode cast\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nJohn Sullivan\\'s father was the inspiration for the smashed chandelier storyline. Working as a plumber in the 1930s, he was part of a group of men who were fitting a new heating system into a stately home, and had to move some chandeliers. As with the Trotters, there was a mix up and the wrong one was undone and smashed. Sullivan found the story hilarious, although his father - who was sacked as a result of the incident - did not see the funny side. After watching the episode, however, he telephoned his son and agreed that it was funny after all. David Jason and Ray Butt agreed that the storyline ought to be used, meaning Sullivan had to write the script backwards, starting with just the end point and then working out how the Trotters would come to be in a mansion. \\n\\nThe smashed chandelier was made by props company Trading Post.  Despite being a fake, it was still worth about £6,000 and only one was made, meaning the scene could only be filmed once. It was initially intended that this would be the final scene in the episode, so after the incident Jason and Lyndhurst were required to stand and stare at each other in silence for 30 seconds while the camera rolled. Lyndhurst later recalled that Butt threatened him with the sack if he ruined the scene by laughing. Many of the cast and crew struggled to contain their laughter in the aftermath of the shot; Butt himself stuffed a handkerchief into his mouth and left the room.\\n\\nGiven the task of finding a suitable \"Ridgemere Hall\", production manager Janet Bone eventually settled on Clayesmore School, a boarding school in Iwerne Minster, Dorset. The school would not give permission for any of its floorboards to be pulled up however, and so the scene with Granddad undoing the fastening nut was filmed in a house that belonged to Ray Butt\\'s girlfriend. The auction house seen at the beginning of the episode is the village hall of Sutton Waldron, Dorset. \\n\\nReception\\n\\n\"A Touch of Glass\" was the first episode of Only Fools and Horses to attract a UK television audience of over 10 million. Owing to the chandelier scene, it is one of the show\\'s best known episodes. In December 2006, the scene came second in a UKTV Gold poll to find the Top 40 Only Fools Moments, second only to Del Boy falling through an open bar flap in the episode \"Yuppy Love\".  It was also voted the best British comedy moment in a 2000 poll. \\n\\nNotes\\nQuestion:\\n\\'A Touch of Glass\\', \\'Friday the 14th\\' and \\'The Miracle of Peckham\\' were episodes in which classic sitcom?\\nAnswer:\\nSunglasses Ron\\nPassage:\\nMary Shakespeare\\nMary Shakespeare, née Arden, (c. 1537–1608) was the mother of William Shakespeare. She was the daughter of Robert Arden. The Arden family had been prominent in Warwickshire since before the Norman Conquest. She was the youngest of eight daughters, and she inherited her father\\'s farm, now called Mary Arden\\'s House, in Wilmcote, Warwickshire when Robert Arden died in December 1556.\\n\\nRichard Shakespeare, the father of John Shakespeare, was a tenant farmer on land owned by her father in Snitterfield. As the daughter of Richard\\'s landlord; she may have known John since childhood.  Mary married John Shakespeare in 1557, when she was 20 years old.  She bore eight children: Joan (1558), Margaret (1562–63), William (1564–1616), Gilbert (1566–1612),″ Joan (1569–1646), Anne (1571–79), Richard (1574–1613), and Edmund (1580–1607).  Though Mary gave birth to many children, several of them died young. Their first daughter, Joan, born 1558 died, the name was used again for their third daughter. Their second daughter, Margaret, also died in infancy.  Some members of the wider Arden family were of the Catholic faith. \\n\\nMary was from a family of status and her ancestors had connections in society, such as Thomas Arden, who fought in the thirteenth-century civil war for the Barons and Simon de Montfort; Robert Arden who fought in the War of Roses; John Arden who served on the court of King Henry VII. Upon her father\\'s death, Mary inherited land in Snitterfield and Wilmcote. \\n\\nMary Arden\\'s House in Wilmcote has been maintained in good condition because it had been a working farmhouse over the centuries. It was bought by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1930 and refurnished in the Tudor period style. \\nIn 2000 it was discovered that the building preserved as Mary Arden\\'s house had belonged to a friend and neighbour Adam Palmer and the house was renamed Palmer\\'s Farm. The house that had belonged to the Arden family which was near to Palmer\\'s Farm had been acquired by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1968 for preservation as part of a farmyard without knowing its true provenance.   The house and farm are open as historic museum displaying 16th century life.\\nQuestion:\\nWho was Mary Arden\\'s famous son?\\nAnswer:\\nShakspeare\\nPassage:\\nThe Commitments (1991) - IMDb\\nThe Commitments (1991) - IMDb\\nIMDb\\nThere was an error trying to load your rating for this title.\\nSome parts of this page won\\'t work property.

The strip was created by Anderson, with help from Phil Leeming (1955–1962) and later Dorothy Leeming (1963–1969), and (since August 2, 2004) Paul Anderson. The strip revolves around the Winslow family and their Great Dane, Marmaduke. The strip on Sundays also has a side feature called \"Dog Gone Funny\", in which one or more panels are devoted to dog anecdotes submitted by the fans. Anderson, who says he draws on Laurel and Hardy routines for his ideas,  received the National Cartoonists Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for the strip in 1978. Anderson died on August 30, 2015, leaving the long-term fate of the strip unknown; strips co-drawn with the help of his son, Paul Anderson, continue to be syndicated.\\n\\nCharacters \\n\\n* Marmaduke\\xa0– A messy but lovable Great Dane owned by the Winslow family\\n* Phil\\xa0– Patriarch of the Winslow family\\n* Dottie\\xa0– Matriarch of the Winslow family\\n* Barbara\\xa0– The Winslows\\' older child\\n* Billy\\xa0– The Winslows\\' younger child\\n* Mr. and Mrs. Snyder\\xa0– The Winslows\\' neighbors\\n* Carlos – The Winslows\\' cat\\n\\nReception\\n\\nBrad Anderson won the National Cartoonists Society\\'s Reuben Award for Newspaper Panel Cartoon in 1978,  and the George Arents Pioneer Medal for Syracuse University alumni in 1999.  \\n\\nAs of 2015, Marmaduke continues to be widely syndicated, and is popular with readers. Attempts to cancel Marmaduke have drawn protest, such as those by readers of The Toronto Star in 1999, of the Sarasota Herald Tribune in 2007,  and of the Chicago Sun-Times in 1986. \\n\\nBrad Anderson died on August 30, 2015 at the age of 91. \\n\\nCriticism\\n\\nThe strip\\'s longevity and perceived monotony  have been noted by satirical publications such as The Onion  and have made it the butt of jokes.: \"Marmaduke has arguably spent 50 years retelling the same two jokes – Marmaduke is a dog with some human qualities, and Marmaduke is gargantuan – but the Star\\'s attempt to drop it in 1999 sparked a reader revolt.\" It has become \"a hot source of retro-ironic-subversive humor.\" For example, a blog called \"Joe Mathlete Explains Today\\'s Marmaduke\"  deconstructs the strip to offer an alternative explanation for what\\'s happening in the drawing.   Another blog called \"Marmaduke Can Vote\" gives each panel a political slant, while another called \"Poignant Marmaduke\" changes all the captions to make the comics sad.   Additionally, \"The Marmaduke Project\" re-imagines Marmaduke in other forms. \\n\\nIn his satirical analysis at The Comic Strip Doctor, David Malki of Wondermark ranked Marmaduke among \"the worst newspaper comic strips\" alongside Heathcliff, Family Circus and Dennis the Menace. \\n\\nAdaptations\\n\\nAnimated series\\n\\nRuby-Spears produced Marmaduke segments',\n",

It is the seventh book by Walliams, a television comedian best known as an actor on the show Little Britain, and as a judge on Britain\\'s Got Talent. \\n\\nThe book tells the story of Stella Saxby, the sole heir to Saxby Hall, who is plagued by her awful Aunt Alberta and her giant owl, who will stop at nothing to take her inheritance from her.  \\n\\nPlot\\n\\nThe book is set in December 1933. The central character is Stella Saxby, whose parents, Lord and Lady Saxby, have died in a tragic automobile accident. In the wake of the tragedy, Stella\\'s Aunt Alberta launches a plot to trick Stella out of her inheritance. Also featured are Wagner (Aunt Alberta\\'s enormous owl), Soot (a chimney sweep) and Gibbon (the Saxby\\'s elderly butler who offers much comic relief). \\n\\nAlberta lives up to her moniker as being awful. She lacks all sympathy and morals, having chosen to fight on the German side in World War I simply because she preferred their uniforms. She has killed and tortured people and loves vicious owls. Stella rightfully fears her, and has to use all her wits to overcome the antagonism.\\n\\nInspiration\\n\\nWalliams says that actress Miriam Margolyes, known among other roles as Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films, was part of the inspiration for Aunt Alberta. The author is quick to note that he is a fan of her work and has nothing against her. He told The Telegraph in an interview, “She came to see me when I was appearing in A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the West End [...] I don’t know her well. I just met her once and she said something rude in front of my aunt.” \\n\\nWalliams also notes that he often writes with actors and actresses in mind, stating for example that Michael Gambon was on his mind as he wrote Mr Stink. \\n\\nReception\\n\\nThe book sold over 50,000 copies in a single week after its release, and has been met with high marks from reviewers.\\n\\nTelevision adaptation\\n\\nOn March 30, 2015, while announcing the Billionaire Boy movie, Walliams also announced a film of Awful Auntie to air during December 2016.\\nQuestion:\\nWho wrote the recent book for children Awful Auntie?\\nAnswer:\\nDavid Walliams\\nPassage:\\nMurphy\\'s law - Wikiquote\\nMurphy\\'s law - Wikiquote\\nMurphy\\'s law\\nJump to: navigation, search\\nMurphy\\'s law is a popular adage that states that \"things will go wrong in any given situation, if you give them a chance,\" or more commonly, \"whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.\" A number of variants on the rule have been formulated, as have several corollaries.\\nOriginal phrasing by Edward A.

As the cuttings are circulated out of the borehole they are sampled, examined (typically under a 10× microscope) and tested chemically when needed.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nPetrology utilizes the fields of mineralogy, petrography, optical mineralogy, and chemical analysis to describe the composition and texture of rocks. Petrologists also include the principles of geochemistry and geophysics through the study of geochemical trends and cycles and the use of thermodynamic data and experiments in order to better understand the origins of rocks.\\n\\nBranches \\n\\nThere are three branches of petrology, corresponding to the three types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary, and another dealing with experimental techniques:\\n\\n*Igneous petrology focuses on the composition and texture of igneous rocks (rocks such as granite or basalt which have crystallized from molten rock or magma). Igneous rocks include volcanic and plutonic rocks.\\n*Sedimentary petrology focuses on the composition and texture of sedimentary',\n",
       "  ' rocks (rocks such as sandstone, shale, or limestone which consist of pieces or particles derived from other rocks or biological or chemical deposits, and are usually bound together in a matrix of finer material).\\n*Metamorphic petrology focuses on the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks (rocks such as slate, marble, gneiss, or schist which started out as sedimentary or igneous rocks but which have undergone chemical, mineralogical or textural changes due to extremes of pressure, temperature or both)\\n*Experimental petrology employs high-pressure, high-temperature apparatus to investigate the geochemistry and phase relations of natural or synthetic materials at elevated pressures and temperatures. Experiments are particularly useful for investigating rocks of the lower crust and upper mantle that rarely survive the journey to the surface in pristine condition. They are also one of the prime sources of information about completely inaccessible rocks such as those in the Earth\\'s lower mantle and in the mantles of the other terrestrial planets and the Moon. The work of experimental petrologists has laid a foundation on which modern understanding of igneous and metamorphic processes has been built.\\nQuestion:\\nLithology is the study of which natural substance?\\nAnswer:\\nStones\\nPassage:\\nLatin Phrases in Common Usage in English - MyAccess\\nLatin Phrases in Common Usage in English\\nLatin Phrases in Common Usage in English\\nThis page was last updated on March 11, 2015\\nThe following table is a list of some Latin Phrases in common English usage.
