    "the bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,\n",

    "to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are\n",

    "But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they\n",

    "it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\n",
    "they're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\n",
    "as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\n",
    "to get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\n",
    "partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\n",
    "it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\n",
    "In fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\n",
    "to use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\n",
    "the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\n",
    "bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\n",
    "and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\n",
    "it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\n",
    "not just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\n",
    "decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\n",
    "example, if your company wants to write some software, it might\n",
    "seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\n",
    "language, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\n",
    "be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\n",
    "smart as the\n",
    "ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\n",
    "And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\n",
    "language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\n",
    "prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\n",
    "merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\n",
    "languages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\n",
    "Betamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\n",
    "just standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\n",
    "means use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\n",
    "A programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\n",
    "language.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\n",
    "medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\n",
    "programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\n",
    "program in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\n",
    "who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\n",
    "Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\n",
    "Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\n",
    "good hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\n",
    "want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\n",
    "you.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\n",
    "the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\n",
    "startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\n",
    "time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\n",
    "on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\n",
    "to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\n",
    "these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\n",
    "hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\n",
    "had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\n",
    "a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\n",
    "a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\n",
    "to be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\n",
    "his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\n",
    "rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\n",
    "use their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\n",
    "company, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\n",
    "in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\n",
    "where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\n",
    "good reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\n",
    "of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\n",
    "hard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\n",
    "cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or\n",
    "late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies\n",
    "realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office\n",
    "environment is supposed to be something that helps\n",
    "you work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,\n",
    "even the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously\n",
    "they still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that\n",
    "Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.\n",
    "They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where\n",
    "presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.\n",
    "I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a\n",
    "door.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to\n",
    "work where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft\n",
    "is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop\n",
    "software in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at\n",
    "what they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves\n",
    "so they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers\n",
    "don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They\n",
    "work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere\n",
    "to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass\n",
    "boxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take\n",
    "a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at\n",
    "their desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with\n",
    "vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime\n",
    "hacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate\n",
    "retreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what\n",
    "they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I\n",
    "said earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows\n",
    "at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're\n",
    "more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular\n",
    "language can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want\n",
    "to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can\n",
    "choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask\n",
    "that question, you find that open source operating systems already\n",
    "have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably\n",
    "Perl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What\n",
    "makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy\n",
    "applications like stealth planes or special effects software would\n",
    "be interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting\n",
    "if it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict\n",
    "which problems hackers will like, because some become\n",
    "interesting only when the people working on them discover a new\n",
    "kind of solution.  Before ITA\n",
    "(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),\n",
    "the people working on airline fare searches probably thought it\n",
    "was one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made\n",
    "it interesting by \n",
    "redefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,\n",
    "the conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search\n",
    "was boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think\n",
    "search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent\n",
    "saying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in\n",
    "ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a\n",
    "more interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at\n",
    "this, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot\n",
    "of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the\n",
    "problem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove\n",
    "the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't\n",
    "even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell\n",
    "from the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in\n",
    "Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac\n",
    "carrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried\n",
    "it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh\n",
    "face, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just\n",
    "like ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not\n",
    "enough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.\n",
    "Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've\n",
    "seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really\n",
    "there should be two articles: one about what to do if\n",
    "you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the \n",
    "second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good\n",
    "hackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're\n",
    "not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar\n",
    "problem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the\n",
    "design paradox.  You might think that you could make your products\n",
    "beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if\n",
    "you yourself don't have good taste, \n",
    "how are you going to recognize\n",
    "a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.\n",
    "And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,\n",
    "because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by\n",
    "fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.\n",
    "There's no way around it:  you can't manage a process intended to\n",

    "cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with\n",
    "bad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,\n",
    "or even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must\n",

    "those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have\n",
    "to solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of\n",
    "projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's\n",
    "full of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize\n",
    "something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.\n",
    "To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand\n",
    "cuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you\n",
    "don't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting\n",
    "because it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface\n",
    "to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the\n",
    "bugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good\n",
    "hackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of\n",
    "self-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you\n",
    "stupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid\n",
    "cheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because\n",
    "of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that\n",
    "found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would\n",
    "be very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had \n",
    "Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the\n",
    "Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of\n",
    "talent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies\n",
    "of which they're the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.\n",
    "They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate\n",
    "R&D department where employees don't have to work directly on\n",
    "customers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research\n",

    "heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \n",
    "hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\n",
    "all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\n",
    "Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\n",

    "that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\n",
    "wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\n",
    "partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\n",

    "Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\n",

    "which shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\n",

    "in general is that hackers are more \n",
    "politically incorrect.  To the\n",
    "extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\n",
    "know one another well enough to express opinions that would get\n",

    "political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\n",
    "Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\n",

    "a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\n",
    "least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\n",
    "it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\n",
    "it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\n",

    "and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\n",
