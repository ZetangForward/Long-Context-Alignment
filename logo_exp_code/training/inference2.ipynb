    "they're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\n",
    "as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\n",
    "to get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\n",
    "partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\n",
    "it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\n",
    "In fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\n",
    "to use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\n",
    "the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\n",
    "bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\n",
    "and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\n",
    "it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\n",
    "not just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\n",
    "decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\n",
    "example, if your company wants to write some software, it might\n",
    "seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\n",
    "language, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\n",

    "smart as the\n",
    "ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\n",
    "And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\n",
    "language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\n",
    "prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\n",
    "merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\n",
    "languages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\n",

    "Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\n",
    "good hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\n",
    "want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\n",
    "you.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\n",
    "the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\n",
    "startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\n",
    "time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\n",
    "on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\n",
    "to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\n",
    "these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\n",
    "hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\n",

    "his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\n",
    "rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\n",
    "use their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\n",
    "company, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\n",
    "in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\n",
    "where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\n",
    "good reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\n",
    "of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\n",
    "hard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\n",
    "cubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or\n",
    "late or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies\n",
    "realize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office\n",
    "environment is supposed to be something that helps\n",
    "you work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,\n",
    "even the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously\n",
    "they still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that\n",
    "Cisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.\n",
    "They get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where\n",
    "presumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.\n",
    "I once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a\n",
    "door.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to\n",
    "work where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft\n",
    "is remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop\n",
    "software in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at\n",
    "what they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves\n",
    "so they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers\n",
    "don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They\n",
    "work in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere\n",
    "to walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass\n",
    "boxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take\n",
    "a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at\n",
    "their desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with\n",
    "vacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime\n",
    "hacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate\n",
    "retreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what\n",
    "they're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I\n",
    "said earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows\n",
    "at work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're\n",
    "more likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular\n",
    "language can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want\n",
    "to know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can\n",
    "choose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask\n",
    "that question, you find that open source operating systems already\n",
    "have a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably\n",

    "makes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy\n",
    "applications like stealth planes or special effects software would\n",
    "be interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting\n",
    "if it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict\n",
    "which problems hackers will like, because some become\n",
    "interesting only when the people working on them discover a new\n",
    "kind of solution.  Before ITA\n",

    "was boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think\n",
    "search was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent\n",
    "saying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in\n",
    "ten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a\n",
    "more interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at\n",
    "this, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot\n",
    "of small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the\n",
    "problem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove\n",
    "the developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't\n",
    "even have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell\n",
    "from the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in\n",
    "Cambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac\n",
    "carrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried\n",
    "it home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh\n",
    "face, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just\n",
    "like ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not\n",
    "enough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.\n",
    "Which usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've\n",
    "seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really\n",
    "there should be two articles: one about what to do if\n",
    "you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the \n",
    "second could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good\n",
    "hackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're\n",
    "not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar\n",
    "problem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the\n",
    "design paradox.  You might think that you could make your products\n",
    "beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if\n",
    "you yourself don't have good taste, \n",
    "how are you going to recognize\n",
    "a good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.\n",
    "And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,\n",
    "because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by\n",

    "those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have\n",
    "to solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of\n",
    "projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's\n",
    "full of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize\n",
    "something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.\n",
    "To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand\n",
    "cuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you\n",
    "don't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting\n",
    "because it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface\n",
    "to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the\n",
    "bugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good\n",
    "hackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of\n",
    "self-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you\n",
    "stupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid\n",
    "cheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because\n",
    "of supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that\n",
    "found a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would\n",
    "be very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had \n",
    "Robert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the\n",
    "Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of\n",
    "talent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies\n",
    "of which they're the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.\n",
    "They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate\n",
    "R&D department where employees don't have to work directly on\n",
    "customers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research\n",
    "department functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe\n",
    "the rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme.  \n",
    "Bottom-up programming\n",
    "suggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people\n",
    "work as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have\n",
    "one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and\n",
    "another that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way\n",
    "you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,\n",
    "but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would\n",
    "be in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have\n",
    "users, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full\n",
    "of security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual\n",
    "applications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating\n",
    "memory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging\n",
    "together big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is\n",
    "the technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other\n",
    "good hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes\n",
    "spectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won't attract good\n",
    "hackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create\n",
    "for them.  The tendency to clump means it's more like the square\n",
    "of the environment.  So it's winner take all.  At any given time,\n",
    "there are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to\n",
    "work, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer\n",
    "great hackers, you'll have zero.Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company\n",
    "successful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of\n",
    "the hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or\n",
    "Xerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model\n",
    "is a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't\n",
    "save you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that\n",
    "can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are\n",
    "people who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds\n",
    "of venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software\n",

    "you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing\n",

    "heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \n",
    "hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\n",
    "all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\n",
    "Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\n",

    "in general is that hackers are more \n",

    "political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\n",
    "Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\n",
    "programmers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\n",
    "a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\n",
    "least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\n",
    "it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\n",
    "it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\n",
    "to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\n",
    "and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\n",

    "have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.\n",
    "The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil painting.\n",

    "They're more like examples of Robert Frost's\n",
    "\"good fences make good neighbors.\"  You can stick instances\n",
    "of good design together, but within each individual project,\n",
    "one person has to be in control.I'm not saying that good design requires that one person think\n",
    "of everything.  There's nothing more valuable than the advice\n",
    "of someone whose judgement you trust.  But after the talking is\n",
    "done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one person.Why is it that research can be done by collaborators and  \n",

    "know the answer.  Perhaps,\n",
    "if design and research converge, the best research is also\n",

    "A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked alone.\n",

    "beat this limitation?I'm inclined to think there isn't-- that good design requires\n",
    "a dictator.  One reason is that good design has to   \n",
    "be all of a piece.  Design is not just for humans, but\n",

    "fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the user's\n",
    "head too.Related:November 2021(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so.\n",

    "would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm\n",

    "means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not\n",
    "just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You\n",

    "either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept\n",

    "are two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement\n",
    "about taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined\n",
    "impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this\n",
    "the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous\n",
    "museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most\n",
    "people's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.\n",
    "The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation\n",
    "are often so different from those admired a few generations later.\n",
    "It's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only\n",
    "when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and\n",
    "comparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in\n",
    "fact exist.The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there\n",
    "doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The\n",
    "argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work\n",
    "of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a\n",
    "property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it\n",
    "doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads\n",
    "of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose\n",
    "between them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art\n",
    "is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.\n",
    "And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the\n",
    "same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the\n",
    "corresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with\n",
    "behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of\n",
    "m. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not\n",
    "binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects\n",
    "have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one\n",
    "pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the\n",
    "other; their reactions aren't random.Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed\n",
    "to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively\n",
    "it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about\n",
    "the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very\n",
    "frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property\n",
    "of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens\n",
    "in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's\n",
    "immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not\n",
    "work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about\n",
    "the effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure\n",
    "effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.\n",
    "You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge\n",
    "of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous\n",

    "for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.\n",
    "Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are\n",
    "smart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem\n",
    "related.  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of\n",
    "situations.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the\n",
    "true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  A\n",
    "wise person is someone who usually knows the right thing to do.And yet isn't being smart also knowing what to do in certain\n",
    "situations?  For example, knowing what to do when the teacher tells\n",
    "your elementary school class to add all the numbers from 1 to 100?\n",
    "[1]Some say wisdom and intelligence apply to different types of\n",
    "problems—wisdom to human problems and intelligence to abstract\n",
    "ones.  But that isn't true.  Some wisdom has nothing to do with\n",
    "people: for example, the wisdom of the engineer who knows certain\n",
    "structures are less prone to failure than others.  And certainly\n",
    "smart people can find clever solutions to human problems as well\n",
    "as abstract ones. \n",
    "[2]Another popular explanation is that wisdom comes from experience\n",
    "while intelligence is innate.  But people are not simply wise in\n",
    "proportion to how much experience they have.  Other things must\n",
    "contribute to wisdom besides experience, and some may be innate: a\n",
    "reflective disposition, for example.Neither of the conventional explanations of the difference between\n",
    "wisdom and intelligence stands up to scrutiny.  So what is the\n",
    "difference?  If we look at how people use the words \"wise\" and\n",
    "\"smart,\" what they seem to mean is different shapes of performance.Curve\"Wise\" and \"smart\" are both ways of saying someone knows what to\n",
    "do.  The difference is that \"wise\" means one has a high average\n",
    "outcome across all situations, and \"smart\" means one does spectacularly\n",
    "well in a few.  That is, if you had a graph in which the x axis\n",
    "represented situations and the y axis the outcome, the graph of the\n",
    "wise person would be high overall, and the graph of the smart person\n",
    "would have high peaks.The distinction is similar to the rule that one should judge talent\n",
    "at its best and character at its worst.  Except you judge intelligence\n",
    "at its best, and wisdom by its average.  That's how the two are\n",
    "related: they're the two different senses in which the same curve\n",
    "can be high.So a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart\n",
    "person knows what to do in situations where few others could.  We\n",
    "need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where\n",
    "someone knows what to do because they have inside information. \n",
    "[3]\n",
    "But aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific\n",
    "without starting to be mistaken.Nor do we need to.  Simple as it is, this explanation predicts, or\n",
    "at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the\n",
    "distinction between wisdom and intelligence.  Human problems are\n",
    "the most common type, so being good at solving those is key in\n",
    "achieving a high average outcome.   And it seems natural that a\n",
    "high average outcome depends mostly on experience, but that dramatic\n",
    "peaks can only be achieved by people with certain rare, innate\n",
    "qualities; nearly anyone can learn to be a good swimmer, but to be\n",
    "an Olympic swimmer you need a certain body type.This explanation also suggests why wisdom is such an elusive concept:\n",
    "there's no such thing.  \"Wise\" means something—that one is\n",
    "on average good at making the right choice.  But giving the name\n",
    "\"wisdom\" to the supposed quality that enables one to do that doesn't\n",
    "mean such a thing exists.  To the extent \"wisdom\" means anything,\n",
    "it refers to a grab-bag of qualities as various as self-discipline,\n",
    "experience, and empathy.  \n",
    "[4]Likewise, though \"intelligent\" means something, we're asking for\n",
    "trouble if we insist on looking for a single thing called \"intelligence.\"\n",
    "And whatever its components, they're not all innate.  We use the\n",
    "word \"intelligent\" as an indication of ability: a smart person can\n",
    "grasp things few others could.  It does seem likely there's some\n",
    "inborn predisposition to intelligence (and wisdom too), but this\n",
    "predisposition is not itself intelligence.One reason we tend to think of intelligence as inborn is that people\n",
    "trying to measure it have concentrated on the aspects of it that\n",
    "are most measurable.  A quality that's inborn will obviously be\n",
    "more convenient to work with than one that's influenced by experience,\n",
    "and thus might vary in the course of a study.  The problem comes\n",
    "when we drag the word \"intelligence\" over onto what they're measuring.\n",
    "If they're measuring something inborn, they can't be measuring\n",
    "intelligence.  Three year olds aren't smart.   When we describe one\n",
    "as smart, it's shorthand for \"smarter than other three year olds.\"SplitPerhaps it's a technicality to point out that a predisposition to\n",
    "intelligence is not the same as intelligence.  But it's an important\n",
    "technicality, because it reminds us that we can become smarter,\n",
    "just as we can become wiser.The alarming thing is that we may have to choose between the two.If wisdom and intelligence are the average and peaks of the same\n",
    "curve, then they converge as the number of points on the curve\n",
    "decreases.  If there's just one point, they're identical: the average\n",

    "tested in an ever wider range of situations.In the time of Confucius and Socrates, people seem to have regarded\n",
    "wisdom, learning, and intelligence as more closely related than we\n",
    "do.  Distinguishing between \"wise\" and \"smart\" is a modern habit.\n",
    "[5]\n",
    "And the reason we do is that they've been diverging.  As knowledge\n",
    "gets more specialized, there are more points on the curve, and the\n",
    "distinction between the spikes and the average becomes sharper,\n",
    "like a digital image rendered with more pixels.One consequence is that some old recipes may have become obsolete.\n",
    "At the very least we have to go back and figure out if they were\n",
    "really recipes for wisdom or intelligence.  But the really striking\n",
    "change, as intelligence and wisdom drift apart, is that we may have\n",
    "to decide which we prefer.  We may not be able to optimize for both\n",
    "simultaneously.Society seems to have voted for intelligence.  We no longer admire\n",
    "the sage—not the way people did two thousand years ago.  Now\n",
    "we admire the genius.  Because in fact the distinction we began\n",
    "with has a rather brutal converse: just as you can be smart without\n",

    "doesn't sound especially admirable.  That gets you James Bond, who\n",
    "knows what to do in a lot of situations, but has to rely on Q for\n",

    "fact, a high average may help support high peaks.  But there are\n",
    "reasons to believe that at some point you have to choose between\n",
    "them.  One is the example of very smart people, who are so often\n",

    "is wise in his way, or wiser than he seems, but he's not wise in\n",
    "the way Confucius or Socrates wanted people to be. \n",
    "[6]NewFor both Confucius and Socrates, wisdom, virtue, and happiness were\n",

    "You develop intelligence as you might develop muscles, through\n",
    "exercise.  But there can't be too much compulsion here.  No amount\n",

    "intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's\n",
    "character—some tendency to be interested in certain types of\n",

    "teacher says.  The more extreme recipes aim to break down your\n",
    "individuality the way basic training does.  But that's not the route\n",

    "to have a good enough grasp of kids' capacities at different ages\n",
    "to know when to be surprised.That's the opposite of traditional recipes for education.  Traditionally\n",
    "the student is the audience, not the teacher; the student's job is\n",
    "not to invent, but to absorb some prescribed body of material.  (The\n",
    "use of the term \"recitation\" for sections in some colleges is a\n",
    "fossil of this.) The problem with these old traditions is that\n",

    "applying rules and standards to intelligence that are really meant\n",

    "told me half his department was on Prozac.  Perhaps if we acknowledge\n",
    "that some amount of frustration is inevitable in certain kinds\n",
    "of work, we can mitigate its effects.  Perhaps we can box it up and\n",

    "In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I\n",
    "started a startup called \n",
    "Viaweb.  \n",
    "Our plan was to write\n",
    "software that would let end users build online stores.\n",
    "What was novel about this software, at the time, was\n",
    "that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages\n",
    "as the interface.A lot of people could have been having this idea at the\n",
    "same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was\n",
    "the first Web-based application.  It seemed such\n",
    "a novel idea to us that we named the company after it:\n",
    "Viaweb, because our software worked via the Web,\n",
    "instead of running on your desktop computer.Another unusual thing about this software was that it\n",
    "was written primarily in a programming language called\n",
    "Lisp. It was one of the first big end-user\n",
    "applications to be written in Lisp, which up till then\n",
    "had been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]The Secret WeaponEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\"\n",
    "and in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what\n",
    "languages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python and\n",
    "Java, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will also\n",
    "want to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system\n",
    "administration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hacker\n",
    "should consider learning Lisp:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience\n",
    "  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make\n",
    "  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you\n",
    "  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It\n",
    "won't get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but\n",
    "it will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages\n",
    "you do want to use, like English.But wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn't stretch that far.  The\n",
    "reason Latin won't get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If you\n",
    "write in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computer\n",
    "language, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,\n",

    "there is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will\n",
    "make you a better programmer, and yet you won't use it.Why not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lisp\n",
    "really does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if it\n",
    "doesn't, then who needs it?This is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a very\n",

    "being equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you're\n",
    "starting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend to\n",
    "be an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you get\n",
    "nothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your\n",
    "competitors will crush you.Robert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn't see any reason\n",
    "not to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyone\n",
    "else was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knew\n",
    "that that didn't mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,\n",
    "you'd be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have to\n",
    "ignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will\n",
    "work the best.This is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you can\n",
    "do what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can't\n",
    "do what all the other startups do.  I don't think a lot of people\n",
    "realize this, even in startups.The average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So if\n",
    "you're running a big company and you do everything the way the\n",
    "average big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the\n",
    "average big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.The same thing will happen if you're running a startup, of course.\n",
    "If you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should\n",
    "expect average performance.  The problem here is, average performance\n",
    "means that you'll go out of business.  The survival rate for startups\n",
    "is way less than fifty percent.  So if you're running a startup,\n",
    "you had better be doing something odd.  If not, you're in trouble.Back in 1995, we knew something that I don't think our competitors\n",
    "understood, and few understand even now:  when you're writing\n",
    "software that only has to run on your own servers, you can use\n",
    "any language you want.  When you're writing desktop software,\n",
    "there's a strong bias toward writing applications in the same\n",
    "language as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applications\n",
    "meant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,\n",
    "especially when you have the source code of both the language and\n",
    "the operating system, you can use whatever language you want.This new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that you\n",
    "can use any language, you have to think about which one to use.\n",
    "Companies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that\n",
    "their competitors do not.If you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.\n",
    "For one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be\n",
    "important in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so\n",
    "a company that could get new features done before its competitors\n",
    "would have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language\n",
    "for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify\n",
    "the effect of rapid development, because you can release software\n",
    "the minute it's done.If other companies didn't want to use Lisp, so much the better.\n",
    "It might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help\n",
    "we could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in\n",
    "business.  We didn't know anything about marketing, or hiring\n",
    "people, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us had\n",
    "ever even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing we\n",
    "were good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.\n",
    "Any advantage we could get in the software department, we would\n",
    "take.So you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesis\n",
    "was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get\n",
    "features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things\n",
    "in our software that they couldn't do.  And because Lisp was so\n",
    "high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs\n",
    "would be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better product\n",
    "for less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up getting\n",
    "all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually\n",
    "go out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.What were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,\n",
    "it worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of\n",
    "twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete\n",
    "with ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the\n",
    "server and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitors\n",
    "had cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.\n",
    "Sometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce\n",
    "features that we didn't have.  But with Lisp our development cycle\n",
    "was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within\n",
    "a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  By\n",
    "the time journalists covering the press release got round to calling\n",
    "us, we would have the new feature too.It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of\n",
    "secret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or\n",
    "something.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler\n",
    "than they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features to\n",
    "us.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone\n",
    "thought possible.When I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of The Day\n",
    "of the Jackal, by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is an\n",
    "assassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassin\n",
    "has to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks\n",
    "the president's route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an\n",
    "old man on crutches, and they never suspect him.Our secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird\n",
    "AI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years\n",
    "it had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it\n",
    "worked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable\n",
    "than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand.  In\n",
    "business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.And so, I'm a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything\n",
    "publicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We never\n",
    "mentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web\n",
    "site, all you'd find were the titles of two books in my bio.  This\n",
    "was no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as little\n",
    "information as possible.  If they didn't know what language our\n",
    "software was written in, or didn't care, I wanted to keep it that\n",
    "way.[2]The people who understood our technology best were the customers.\n",
    "They didn't care what language Viaweb was written in either, but\n",
    "they noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build great\n",
    "looking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word of\n",
    "mouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 we\n",

    "The Blub ParadoxWhat's so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn't\n",
    "everyone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually\n",
    "they have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not because\n",
    "of some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is\n",
    "simply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyone\n",
    "doesn't use it is that programming languages are not merely\n",
    "technologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes\n",
    "slower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.I'll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming\n",
    "languages vary in power.Few would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more\n",
    "powerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agree\n",
    "that you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.\n",
    "Instead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a\n",
    "compiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea is\n",
    "even built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets\n",
    "have been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand\n",
    "in machine language.  What's less often understood is that there\n",
    "is a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of\n",
    "several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake\n",
    "to program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]There are many exceptions to this rule.  If you're writing a program\n",
    "that has to work very closely with a program written in a certain\n",
    "language, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the\n",
    "same language.  If you're writing a program that only has to do\n",
    "something very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,\n",
    "you may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it\n",
    "may be slightly faster.  And if you're writing a short, throwaway\n",
    "program, you may be better off just using whatever language has\n",
    "the best library functions for the task.  But in general, for\n",
    "application software, you want to be using the most powerful\n",
    "(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything\n",
    "else is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a\n",
    "lesser degree, as programming in machine language.You can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least\n",
    "as a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all\n",
    "treated as equivalent.  They're not.  Technically the term \"high-level\n",
    "language\" doesn't mean anything very definite.  There's no dividing\n",
    "line with machine languages on one side and all the high-level\n",
    "languages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of\n",
    "abstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine\n",
    "languages, which themselves vary in power.Consider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that\n",
    "it gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriously\n",
    "argue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It's\n",
    "probably closer to machine language than Python.Or how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures\n",
    "got added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl\n",
    "5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you've admitted that,\n",
    "you've admitted that one high level language can be more powerful\n",
    "than another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special\n",
    "cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.This idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After a\n",
    "certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.\n",
    "Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider\n",
    "just good enough.Programmers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I\n",
    "don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so to explain this point I'm\n",
    "going to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls right\n",
    "in the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the most\n",
    "powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine\n",
    "language.And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either\n",
    "of them.  Of course he wouldn't program in machine language.  That's\n",
    "what compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how\n",
    "anyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn't even have x (Blub\n",
    "feature of your choice).As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the\n",
    "power continuum, he knows he's looking down.  Languages less powerful\n",
    "than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some\n",
    "feature he's used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer\n",
    "looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't\n",
    "realize he's looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.\n",
    "He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but\n",
    "with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is good\n",
    "enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of\n",
    "the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that\n",
    "he in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done in\n",
    "Blub? It doesn't even have y.By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the\n",
    "differences in power between the various languages are those who\n",
    "understand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what Eric\n",
    "Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can't\n",
    "trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:\n",
    "they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because\n",
    "it dictates the way they think about programs.I know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing\n",
    "programs in Basic.  That language didn't even support recursion.\n",
    "It's hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but\n",
    "I didn't miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was a\n",
    "whiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at\n",
    "various points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relative\n",
    "to one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that I\n",
    "think Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I'll tell you\n",
    "about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other\n",
    "four languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,\n",
    "without macros? [5]Many languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros are\n",
    "unique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the\n",
    "parentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn't put all those parentheses\n",
    "in the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp\n",
    "code looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.\n",
    "They are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between\n",
    "Lisp and other languages.Lisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivial\n",
    "sense that the source files contain characters, and strings are\n",
    "one of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, after\n",
    "it's read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can\n",
    "traverse.If you understand how compilers work, what's really going on is\n",
    "not so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no\n",
    "syntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated\n",
    "within the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But these\n",
    "parse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write\n",
    "programs that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are called\n",
    "macros.  They are programs that write programs.Programs that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?\n",
    "Not very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you think\n",
    "in Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example\n",
    "of a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,\n",
    "it would just look like gibberish to someone who didn't know Lisp;\n",
    "there isn't room here to explain everything you'd need to know to\n",
    "understand what it meant.  In \n",
    "Ansi Common Lisp I tried to move\n",
    "things along as fast as I could, and even so I didn't get to macros\n",
    "until page 160.But I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.\n",
    "The source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%\n",
    "macros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,\n",

    "it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\n",
    "they're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\n",
    "as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\n",
    "to get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\n",
    "partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\n",
    "it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\n",
    "In fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\n",
    "to use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\n",
    "the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\n",
    "bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\n",
    "and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\n",
    "it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\n",
    "not just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\n",
    "decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\n",
    "example, if your company wants to write some software, it might\n",
    "seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\n",
    "language, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\n",
    "be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\n",
    "smart as the\n",
    "ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\n",
    "And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\n",
    "language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\n",
    "prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\n",
    "merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\n",
    "languages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\n",
    "Betamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\n",
    "just standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\n",
    "means use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\n",
    "A programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\n",
    "language.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\n",
    "medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\n",
    "programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\n",
    "program in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\n",
    "who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\n",
    "Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\n",
    "Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\n",
    "good hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\n",
    "want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\n",
    "you.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\n",
    "the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\n",
    "startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\n",
    "time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\n",
    "on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\n",
    "to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\n",
    "these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\n",
    "hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\n",
    "had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\n",
    "a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\n",
    "a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\n",
    "to be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\n",
    "his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\n",
    "rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\n",
    "use their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\n",

    "where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\n",
    "good reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\n",
    "of being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\n",
    "hard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\n",

    "brain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in\n",
    "a lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?\n",
    "I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was\n",
    "curiosity.  \n",
    "I'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--\n",
    "that curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But\n",

    "heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \n",
    "hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\n",
    "all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\n",
    "Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\n",
    "head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just\n",
    "that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\n",
    "wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\n",
    "partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\n",
    "means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley\n",
    "had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.\n",
    "Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\n",

    "which shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\n",
    "in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,\n",

    "in general is that hackers are more \n",
    "politically incorrect.  To the\n",
    "extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\n",
    "know one another well enough to express opinions that would get\n",
    "them stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why\n",
    "political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\n",
    "Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\n",
    "programmers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\n",
    "a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\n",
    "least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\n",
    "it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\n",
    "it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\n",
    "to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\n",
    "and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\n",

    "novelist, are you producing?  Are you writing pages of fiction,\n",
    "however bad?  As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not\n",

    "ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious\n",
    "effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated\n",
    "by what seems possible. \n",
    "[6]It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe\n",
    "the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their\n",
    "expectations.  For example, if you asked random people on the street\n",
    "if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most\n",
    "would say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\"  This is more a statement\n",

    "the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow\n",
    "got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the\n",
    "next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far.  But it would require\n",
    "a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every\n",
    "day for years.  And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do\n",
    "work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs.  Really?\n",
    "How do you make them?  In the US the only mechanism for forcing\n",
    "people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been\n",
    "invoked for over 30 years.  All we can do is encourage people to\n",
    "do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society\n",
    "just has to make do without.  That's what happened with domestic\n",
    "servants.  For millennia that was the canonical example of a job\n",
    "\"someone had to do.\"  And yet in the mid twentieth century servants\n",
    "practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just\n",
    "had to do without.So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good\n",
    "chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken.\n",
    "Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no\n",
    "one were willing to do them.Two RoutesThere's another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\"\n",
    "that's all too true, however.  One has to make a living, and it's\n",
    "hard to get paid for doing work you love.  There are two routes to\n",
    "that destination:\n",
    "\n",
    "  The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to\n",
    "  increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of\n",
    "  those you don't.The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money\n",
    "  to work on things you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyone\n",
    "who does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever work\n",
    "he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position\n",
    "to pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this route\n",
    "is that it's slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you\n",
    "work for money at a time.  At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where\n",
    "you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what\n",
    "you love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work at\n",
    "something till you make enough not to \n",
    "have to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because\n",
    "it requires a deliberate choice.  It's also more dangerous.  Life\n",
    "tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get\n",
    "sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.\n",
    "Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work too\n",
    "long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best paying\n",
    "jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over\n",
    "obstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are\n",
    "walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. \n",

    "enough information to make each choice before you need to make it.\n",
    "But this is certainly not so with work.  When you're deciding what\n",
    "to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information.\n",

    "the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you\n",
    "get better results if you use flexible media.  So unless you're\n",
    "fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a\n",
    "type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job\n",
    "career.  That was probably part of the reason I chose computers.\n",
    "You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into\n",
    "any number of other kinds of work.It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different\n",

    "they really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay\n",
    "the bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,\n",

    "This isn't quite true.  It is true that all they really care about\n",

    "to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are\n",
    "attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.\n",
    "But as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they\n",
    "care more about what they do there than how much they get paid for\n",
    "it.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because\n",
    "it means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\n",
    "they're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\n",
    "as productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\n",
    "to get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\n",
    "partly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\n",
    "it's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\n",
    "In fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\n",
    "to use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\n",
    "the wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\n",
    "bulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\n",
    "and the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\n",
    "it.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\n",
    "not just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\n",
    "decision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\n",
    "example, if your company wants to write some software, it might\n",
    "seem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\n",
    "language, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\n",
    "be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\n",
    "smart as the\n",
    "ones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\n",
    "And the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\n",
    "language you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\n",
    "prefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\n",
    "merits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\n",
    "languages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\n",
    "Betamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\n",
    "just standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\n",
    "means use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\n",
    "A programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\n",
    "language.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\n",
    "medium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\n",
    "programmers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\n",
    "program in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\n",
    "who don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\n",
    "Not just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\n",
    "Good hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\n",
    "good hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\n",
    "want them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\n",
    "you.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\n",
    "the operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\n",
    "startup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\n",
    "time I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\n",
    "on Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\n",
    "to be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\n",
    "these guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\n",
    "hacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\n",
    "had to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\n",
    "a great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\n",
    "a hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\n",
    "to be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\n",
    "his office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\n",
    "rank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\n",
    "use their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\n",
    "company, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\n",
    "in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\n",
    "where the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\n",

    "well.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at\n",
    "age 14.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your\n",
    "brain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in\n",
    "a lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?\n",
    "I asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was\n",
    "curiosity.  \n",

    "heads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \n",
    "hackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\n",
    "all.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\n",
    "Perhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\n",
    "head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just\n",
    "that line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\n",
    "wrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\n",
    "partly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\n",
    "means about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley\n",
    "had 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.\n",
    "Maybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\n",
    "using a very dense language, \n",
    "which shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\n",
    "in charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,\n",
    "have no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having\n",
    "one's brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism\n",
    "are true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people\n",
    "in general is that hackers are more \n",
    "politically incorrect.  To the\n",
    "extent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\n",
    "know one another well enough to express opinions that would get\n",
    "them stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why\n",
    "political incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\n",
    "Programs are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\n",
    "programmers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\n",
    "a habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\n",
    "least not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\n",
    "it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\n",
    "it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\n",
    "to work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\n",
    "and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\n",
    "All the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though\n",
    "perhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes\n",

    "[6]It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe\n",

    "\n",
    "  The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to\n",

    "  those you don't.The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money\n",
    "  to work on things you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organic route is more common.  It happens naturally to anyone\n",
    "who does good work.  A young architect has to take whatever work\n",
    "he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position\n",
    "to pick and choose among projects.  The disadvantage of this route\n",
    "is that it's slow and uncertain.  Even tenure is not real freedom.The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you\n",
    "work for money at a time.  At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where\n",
    "you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what\n",
    "you love in your spare time.  At the other extreme you work at\n",
    "something till you make enough not to \n",
    "have to work for money again.The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because\n",
    "it requires a deliberate choice.  It's also more dangerous.  Life\n",
    "tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get\n",
    "sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job.\n",
    "Worse still, anything you work on changes you.  If you work too\n",
    "long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain.  And the best paying\n",
    "jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over\n",
    "obstacles.  The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are\n",
    "walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. \n",
    "[7]\n",

    "enough information to make each choice before you need to make it.\n",

    "at Bell Labs, but when he started his own company in 1956 he moved\n",

    "various ways from Shockley Semiconductor.  Shockley was a difficult\n",
    "man, and in 1957 his top people-- \"the traitorous eight\"-- left to\n",
    "start a new company, Fairchild Semiconductor.  Among them were\n",
    "Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, who went on to found Intel, and\n",
    "Eugene Kleiner, who founded the VC firm Kleiner Perkins.  Forty-two\n",
    "years later, Kleiner Perkins funded Google, and the partner responsible\n",
    "for the deal was John Doerr, who came to Silicon Valley in 1974 to\n",
    "work for Intel.So although a lot of the newest companies in Silicon Valley don't\n",
    "make anything out of silicon, there always seem to be multiple links\n",
    "back to Shockley.  There's a lesson here: startups beget startups.\n",
    "People who work for startups start their own.  People who get rich\n",
    "from startups fund new ones.  I suspect this kind of organic growth\n",
    "is the only way to produce a startup hub, because it's the only way\n",
    "to grow the expertise you need.That has two important implications.  The first is that you need\n",
    "time to grow a silicon valley.  The university you could create in\n",
    "a couple years, but the startup community around it has to grow\n",
    "organically.   The cycle time is limited by the time it takes a\n",
    "company to succeed, which probably averages about five years.The other implication of the organic growth hypothesis is that you\n",
    "can't be somewhat of a startup hub.  You either have a self-sustaining\n",
    "chain reaction, or not.  Observation confirms this too: cities\n",
    "either have a startup scene, or they don't.  There is no middle\n",
    "ground.  Chicago has the third largest metropolitan area in America.\n",
    "As source of startups it's negligible compared to Seattle, number 15.The good news is that the initial seed can be quite small.  Shockley\n",
    "Semiconductor, though itself not very successful, was big enough.\n",
    "It brought a critical mass of experts in an important new technology\n",

    "one didn't: it has to compete with Silicon Valley.  Can that be\n",
    "done?  Probably.One of Silicon Valley's biggest advantages is its venture capital\n",
    "firms.  This was not a factor in Shockley's day, because VC funds\n",
    "didn't exist.  In fact, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild\n",
    "Semiconductor were not startups at all in our sense.  They were\n",
    "subsidiaries-- of Beckman Instruments and Fairchild Camera and\n",
    "Instrument respectively.  Those companies were apparently willing\n",
    "to establish subsidiaries wherever the experts wanted to live.Venture investors, however, prefer to fund startups within an hour's\n",
    "drive.  For one, they're more likely to notice startups nearby.\n",
    "But when they do notice startups in other towns they prefer them\n",
    "to move.  They don't want to have to travel to attend board meetings,\n",
    "and in any case the odds of succeeding are higher in a startup hub.The centralizing effect of venture firms is a double one: they cause\n",
    "startups to form around them, and those draw in more startups through\n",
    "acquisitions.  And although the first may be weakening because it's\n",
    "now so cheap to start some startups, the second seems as strong as ever.\n",
    "Three of the most admired\n",
    "\"Web 2.0\" companies were started outside the usual startup hubs,\n",
    "but two of them have already been reeled in through acquisitions.Such centralizing forces make it harder for new silicon valleys to\n",
    "get started.  But by no means impossible.  Ultimately power rests\n",
    "with the founders.  A startup with the best people will beat one\n",
    "with funding from famous VCs, and a startup that was sufficiently\n",
    "successful would never have to move.  So a town that\n",

    "as the human body.  Some ideas are easy for people to grasp\n",
    "and some aren't.  For example, we seem to have a very limited\n",
    "capacity for dealing with detail.  It's this fact that makes\n",
    "programing languages a good idea in the first place; if we\n",
    "could handle the detail, we could just program in machine\n",
    "language.Remember, too, that languages are not\n",
    "primarily a form for finished programs, but something that\n",
    "programs have to be developed in.  Anyone in the arts could\n",
    "tell you that you might want different mediums for the\n",

    "medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible one\n",
    "for developing new ideas.A program, like a proof,\n",
    "is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had\n",

    "A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs\n",

    "real effects on the design of the language.  It would not\n",
